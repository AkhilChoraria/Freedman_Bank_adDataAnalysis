1865,6,13,1865061312201,New York Daily Tribune,NY,freedman's savings bank in richmond - reorganizing a colored church - getting rid of a rebel preacher - deliberations - what « uncle tom » said - an unanswerable speech - burrying money - a negro who had made enough - another meeting to be called,"mr. hewitt, first vice-president of the « fsb » of new york was here a few days ago for the purpose of establishing a branch in this city for the benefit of the colored people. it was arranged that he should present the subject to a meeting of the leading colored men, who were to be assembled for the purpose. at the hour appointed, mr. hewitt, accompanied by  mr. coo[c], superintendent of the colored schools, the rev. mr. dudley and mr. van vleet, repaired to the ebenezer church, where they found about 100 colored men earnestly engaged in reorganizing their church. this was a baptist church, and, according to virginia slave law, they were obliged to have a white pastor ; but, since their emancipation, they determined that they would get rid of the old rebel preacher, and have one who would give them the true gospel as preached in the north, as they had tried the southern religion long enough - i quote their own language. when we entered, they were busily engaged in discussing the propriety of adopting a written constitution. their new minister, a colored man from boston, was chairman of the meeting, the secretary being an intelligent mulatre, who kept the minutes as correctly as any white man could do. some of them thought the bible was constitution enough, while others maintained and gave good reasons for a different opinion. their discussions were conducted according to parliamentary law, which they seemed to understand quite well. to cut off debate, on a certain point, the previous question was called, and they went through the business correctly and without balting, which is not always the case in white deliberative bodies. there was quite a strong opposition to adopting the form of church government they were considering, and the tide of sentiment appeared to be setting against it, when an old « uncle tom » arose, and made an animated and sensible speech in favor of adopting the document before them, and which he had presented. in the course of his speech he told them the following history of the paper which they seemed about to reject. he said that a few years ago he happened to be in the country where some white brothers were organizing a baptist church, and they adopted the very same document he had given them. one of the brothers gave him a copy, which he at first refused, as he did not suppose it would ever be of any use to him, but something told him to keep it, for the time would come when his people would be free, and then they would want to have church organization, and so he kept it, and hid it away ; several white men tried to get it away from him, but when they wanted it he [?] had it, and now, thank god, we are free, and we want our own church - our own pastor, and our own constitution, god gave it to me and enabled me to keep it. i have this [?] placed it upon your table, and he meant that you should need it. you may think i am superstitious, but god has lately manifested this goodness toward us in such a remarkable manner that i believe he intended this for us, and i hope you will accept it. the speech was unanswerable, the vote was immediately taken and the document was unanimously adopted, and as soon as the result was declared they [?] down, and the good old man whose simple story had carried the point, made an eloquent and touching prayer, and when he prayed for the president of the united states and for the preservation of the union they all audibly and fervently united with him. having disposed of the business before them, they invited mr. hewitt to address them, when he clearly unfolded the plan for a saving bank. they listened with earnest attention, and at once comprehended the whole subject, but wished to hear the opinions of the other gentlemen, which were given in favor of the institution, and then they began. one man said that for the want of such a bank he had lost $3,000. he had always made plenty of money, but he had no place to keep it ; he had given some to white men to keep for him, and they had always kept it ; he had buried some and could never find it, and he was glad that now he could have some place to put his money where it would be safe. another said that during the war he buried $700 in gold, and someone had scratched it up. [a general laugh]. an amusing story was told of an old negro, who had been quite industrious and mande considerable money, but suddenly became indolent and no longer tried to accumulate wealth. when called upon for an explanation, he said he didn't want any money, for when he had it it gave him too much trouble and made him unhappy. he had no secure place to keep it ; he used to keep his door locked, his windows nailed down, and his chimney stopped up, to keep it from being stolen, and yet he lost it, and therefore the only way to be happy was not to be bothered with money. several interesting stories were told about the disposition of funds raised by them for benevolent and missionary purposes, and how those funds had been used by store dealers for the purpose of trading in stores, but which could not have been done if they had had a bank of their own. in discussing this matter they manifested a surprising degree of business shrewdness and intelligence. one old man wanted to know what security they would have that their money would be safe? mr. hewitt told him that the company was composed of a large number of the best and wealthiest men in the united states, but as they were not personally responsible, he could only trust to their honor and integrity of character. were there any old rebels and slaveholders among them, continued the inquirer? no, said mr. hewitt, they are all northern men, and your friends. « den, dat's all right », was the response from several. « but » continued the old man, « what's done wid de money ». that, said, mr. hewitt, is invested in united states stocks. at this reply, the old financier stood a moment as if in profound meditation, and then said with apparent satisfaction. « well, den, de bank can't break widont de united states breaks, and dar's no danger of that, though de rebels tried a mighty hard to break it », and took his seat amid a merry laugh. mr. hewitt proposed that they should consider this matter - call another meeting, and then appoint a committee to take the matter in hand ; but they told him that was not fast enough for them - they understood the matter - wanted the bank, and would immediately appoint a committee of fifteen to enter upon the business at once, which was done, and then passing a resolution of thanks for this new manifestation of friendship on the part of their white friends, resumed their church matters, and we retired surprised at the business intelligence and progressive character of these people.

its place with the best and safest of the established institutions of the country. it rose in a period of great financial depression, and during the two short years of its existence has weathered storms and panics. from all of these it has come forth triumphant, and now enjoys the confidence of the whole country. in saying that this is principally if not altogether due to the unwearied efforts, energy and business capacity of its president, andrew simonds, esq., we only express the unanimous opinion of the whole community.
yesterday the bank removed to its new building (formerly occupied by the farmers' and exchange bank) and celebrated the event by a handsome collation in the hall over the bank. we had the pleasure of assisting at this genial reunion, where many of our businessmen spent an hour or two in pleasant converse and in the discussion of the abundant good cheer provided by mine host of the mills house. 
the building is well known to all our city readers and needs no detailed description. it had been considerably injured by the casualties of war, but of these there is no longer a trace visible. to messrs. sawner & ferguson, the contractors, is due this pleasing metamorphosis. the carpentering work executed under their immediate supervision. the value, door, and burglar proof safes are form lillie’s safe and iron company, new york. the counter, desks, and railing are furnished by lewis & beecher company, new haven, and are tasteful in design, of excellent material, and thorough finish.
the loul ensemble of the banking house was much admired by the numerous visitors yesterday, and everyone went away wishing success and prosperity to the first national bank."

dividends. the board, in their last annual report, in referring to the subject of dividends, used the following language: ""the board is not willing to close its annual report without a word upon a subject which they have reason to believe has been regarded with great interest - the dividends. the statements abundantly show that the income of the properly has reached figures which unmistakably indicate a dividend earned. but the wants of the operative departments indicate the necessity of a similar application of the earnings for another year. should it be found practicable to dispense with any portion thereof, it will be equally the pleasure and duty of the board to distribute the same in dividends to the stockholders."" it has been already shown that the net earnings of the year, as anticipated, were needed and have been applied to the heavy work reported to have executed during the year. the most, if not the whole of such work, in dispensable necessary, may now be regarded completed; and the board can now turn their attention to the floating debt and the arrangement of the company’s finances. 
with an income as large only as that of the year just past, they can see no difficulty in greatly reducing, if not entirely extinguishing the floating debt. that accomplished, and sch an arrangement of the past-due bonds realized as will enable the board to act without embarrassment or apprehension, not reasonable difficulty would be in the way of commencing the payment of dividends.

the banks receive an enormous bonus under the present system, and if that system is to be continued and the national currency permanently saddled upon the country, the notes ought ot be made perfectly safe. in a certain sense they are safe now because the government is liable as endorser. but the government may lose by its endorsement and the loss falls, of necessity, upon the taxpayers. if the banks were required to make their notes safe, at gold rates, the loss, if any, would fall upon the stockholders only, and these, as the sole parties interested in the profits, are the proper persons to bear the losses of an unsuccessful venture.

in estimating the contingent liabilities of the state, the notes issued by the bank of the state of southcarolina, amounting, according to the report of the president to the legislature, dated 1st october, 1868to $3,807,549 61,.were not embraced, for the reason that, in my judgment, there is no legal liability devolved upon the state to make good an portion of this issue. this report shows that the issues of the bank of notes under one dollar, up to and since 1861, amounts alone to the enormous sum of $790,000. it is not stated what sum in bills above the denomination 0; one dollar was issued after december 1860, but it is believed that a very large amount was advanced to the confederate government.
the new constitution, in one of its clauses, expressly prohibits the payment of any debt ""contracted in behalf of the late rebellion."" in the present instance, it ls impossible to distinguish what bills were issued prior to and since the beginning of war. if, however, no objection of this sort existed, there would be, in my opinion, no liability on the part of the state to redeem any portion of these bills. it is true, that the capital was originally furnished by the state, but the bank was an incorporated institution, liable to sue and be sued, and the bill holders can enforce some remedies against it and make its assets liable as against any other bank. the obligation of the state to receive bans bills in the payment of taxes, is qualified by the provision that the banks must be specie paving institutions, and no such obligation exists unless the notes are redeemed in specie.
a bill has already been flied in the court of chancery for charleston district, by dabney, morgan & co., bill holders, against the president and director of the bank of the state of south carolina. the attorney-general called my attention to the fact and desired to know whether it was my purpose to have an answer filed in behalf of the state. entertaining the opinions already expressed, that there is no liability on the part of the state, i instructed the attorney general that it was my determination to take no notice whatever of the proceedings. if the general assembly should arrive at a different conclusion, they can adopt such a course as will ensure the representation of the state by counsel upon the trial of the cause."

1870,1,13,1870011301201,New National Era,VA,what the great labor convention thinks about the savings banks.,"during the first days of november there was in session in washington city a convention representing the laboring people of color throughout the united states. that convention appointed a committee to consider and report upon the matter of savings banks and as the result, the following report was presented and unanimously adopted with great enthusiasm in a full meeting of the convention: report. gentlemen of the labor convention: in all communities where labor is properly organized the interest of the poor man is held to be of chief importance. it is the man who, in days of health and prosperity, can save but little above a bare living, and who, in days of sickness and forced idleness, must, with his family, suffer or live on charity, whom wise laws seek to protect. and this is right, because the poor are in all places the vast majority. for this great multitude the way to a better condition should be laid open, and the free school, the open bible, the savings bank, and every invitation to intelligence, virtue, and economy meet all who travel it. after a careful examination of the statistics of savings banks, we have found that wherever labor is best paid, and the improvement of the condition of the laboring classes most carefully considered, there savings banks abound ; there depositors are most numerous, and the aggregate of savings the largest. thus - in massachusetts, at the date of the latest report to the legislature, there were in the state, 108 savings banks: 350,000 depositors, and $80,431,583. in the little state of rhode island, 25 banks ; 59,071 depositors, and $21,413,648. in the cities of new york and brooklyn, 41 banks: 405,591 depositors, and $116,971,953: and in the whole state of new york, in 1868. the aggregate capital in all the savings banks reached the enormous aggregate of $151,127,562. in the state of rhode island one person out of every three has a deposit in some savings bank. in massachusetts and connecticut, one in every three and one-half. in the six new england states, one in every 4.89. in new york, one in 7.22. but the savings bank as an institution; as a great conservator of the well-being of the poor: as a perpetual invitation in each city, town, and village to youth an 1 health to put safely by something against the day of old age and sickness, is just beginning to find a footing south of the potomac. until the close of the late war there was no civilized labor in the south. the employer was at the same time the owner of the laboring man. what inducement was there for the toiler to put by his money? what money of his own had he to put by? with the earnest desire to place within reach of the disenthralled race the opportunity and incentive to careful savings and safe keeping of small earnings, at the close of the war, congress granted a charter to a company called the fsb, with authority to establish, in any one of our states, savings banks for the safe keeping and investment in the stocks, bonds, and treasury notes of the united states the savings of the colored people. one of the last acts of the lamented president lincoln was to affix his signature to the charter giving legal existence to this company. this was in march, 1865. let us now show, in a few words, what has been done by this company in the space of less than five years: in that comparatively short time, banks for savings have been established in augusta, macon, and savannah, georgia; in beaufort and charleston, south carolina; in jacksonville and tallahassee, florida ; in mobile and huntsville, alabama: in new orleans, louisiana ; in vicksburg, mississippi ; in chattanooga, memphis, and nashville, tennessee ; in louisville, kentucky ; in st. louis, missouri ; in martinsburg, richmond, and norfolk, virginia ; in raleigh, wilmington, and newbern, north carolina ; and in washington, baltimore, and new york, with a parent or principal office in washington. beginning with nothing, of course, in the midst of a people just escaped from the shackles of slavery, at the end of one year from the date of its charter, to wit, on the 1st day of march, 1866, deposits were - $305,167 24 – march 1867 deposits were 1,624,853 33, march 1868 deposits were - 3,582,378 36 march 1869 - 7,257,798 63 and to-day the aggregate of all the deposits is over ten millions! of course there have been constant and heavy drafts from these aggregates. depositors, when they have accumulated a few hundred dollars in the bank, quite naturally desire to buy a piece of land, or to enter upon some mercantile or mechanical pursuit. so they draw out money which, but for the bank, would probably never have been saved, and invest as they see opportunity. a population of small land-owners, traders, and mechanics - the very element of a true democratic civilization is appearing on the once lordly domains of the planter. the former chattel, thrown upon his own resources, is called, by the necessities of his position, to look out for to-morrow. so he needs his earnings from time to time. the drafts, for the period above specified, were as follows: year ending march 1, 1867, - $1,225,928 16, year ending march 1, 1868 - 2,944,079 36, year ending march 1, 1869 - 6,184,368 71. at the last date, the net deposit remaining in the bank, invested in united states securities or in cash and office property, was $1,073,429 92. on the 31st of october, the date of the latest published report, this deposit had reached $1,340,133 94. it will probably have reached  two millions within the next year. these savings, as fast as accumulated, are loaned to the united states, i e, invested in their bonds and stocks. the company has paid up to november, 1st, 1869, regularly to its depositors interest at the rate of 5 per cent, in triennial instalments, which, on being entered on the depositor's book as a new deposit, gives him really 1 2/3 percent, each four months, compounded three times per annum. in connection with the other work of the bank, it issues monthly, - for gratuitous distribution, to stimulate its patrons to habits of temperance, thrift, and frugality - a newspaper, which is sought for eagerly. we may add that we find this bank to be established on the mutual principle. each depositor is a stockholder to the amount of his deposits. after paying, out of its income, the expenses of the business of the institution, the balance of its profits are distributed to its depositors every four months. the larger the amount of its deposits the greater the advantage to the stockholder, i e to the depositor. every man. woman, or child, who is able to deposit $5 in this bank is a stockholder to that amount, and receives his or her share of the profits which may accrue from the successful management of its business. your committee have to report that the opposition among the white people of the south to the progress of these banks is disappearing ; that the security and safety of the bank is now thoroughly established ; that it has purchased, in the city of washington, a property directly opposite the united states treasury, where it will build a convenient banking-house in the coming year ; that the best friends of the colored people are the friends and patrons of this bank. major general o. o. howard calls it ""the best educator in the field."" among the names of its trustees are found those of henry d. cooke, esq., of the house of jay cooke & co. ; hon. j. m., brodhead, of the united states treasury ; gen. b. w. brice. paymaster general, u. s. army; bishop s. talbot, of the m. e. church, and others well known throughout the land. but, though the deposits have reached one and a half millions of dollars, your committee i think that such amount but poorly represents the savings of the colored people within reach of the influence of this company. there are within easy reach of its 25 bank 300.000 laboring people of color. if each had only $10 in the bank the aggregate would be three millions - more than double the sum now on deposit in them. or if, out of the three hundred thousand people referred to above, the same proportion were depositors as are found among the laboring people of rhode island, we would have 100,000 depositors and $2,660,000. in conclusion, your committee would report the following resolutions: resolved, that, as an aid to the laboring man, affording a safe and profitable place of investment for his small savings, we commend the national fsb.
resolved, that we are of the opinion that in all the principal cities of the south the colored people should unite in establishing these savings banks, which we believe to be an incentive to the economy, as well as a proper place for keeping its fruits. william j. wilson, f. g. barbadoes, abram smith, j. m. turner, james harris, committee."

1870,3,10,1870031001201,New National Era,VA,freedmen's savings and trust company. to the editor of the new era,"sir: the reliable character of the « fsb, » although well known to a large circle of friends of the institution, has not yet reached wide publicity, and may have escaped the notice of many who would be benefited by becoming depositors, or aid the institution by influencing others to become so. an abstract of a report to the trustees of two journeys, made since december 1st, may be acceptable: i visited eleven branches of our institution, viz : raleigh, wilmington, n. c., charleston, s. c., augusta, macon,savannah, and atlanta, ga., chattanooga and nashville,tenn., louisville, ky., and baltimore. i carefully examined their location, condition, method of keeping accounts, deposits and balances, especially the safety with which funds, books, and archives are kept. in most cases i mot the advisory committees, or consulted leading members of the same. at a number of places i held public bank meetings, and in all the schools visited - more than one hundred in number - insisted on the duty of commencing saving in early youth. the hands of children would go up by dozens when i inquired for actual depositors. confidence in our company has become very general with all classes. the ""old time slaveholder,"" even, is willing that the negro should save his money. active opposition, as far as i could learn, is only from whisky dealers, lottery gamblers, circus men, and a certain class of bounty and claim agents. those parties desire freedmen to spend their money toil a them rather than save it. our bank, with its twenty-five branches, has now become an institution of the colored race, a great lever in their entire elevation, stimulating industry, enterprise and education ; indeed, is in itself an educator, almost equal to the schools. the $1,500,000 now on deposit is only the money value of its benefits. the whole civilization and culture of the freedman feel its influence. even the $10,000,000 drawn from us and invested in important purchases, is a matter of congratulation. comforts innumerable have been multiplied. thousands of families arc thereby settled in permanent homes. a detailed statement could be given of what has been done in all directions with the larger part of this immense sum in the permanent improvement of these people. at charleston, s. c.. we have a choice property, well purchased, commodious, and everything properly secured. as owned by themselves, this banking-house has become the pride of the freedmen of charleston. at beaufort we own the office and over 20,000 feet of land. at vicksburg, a fine banking-house was recently purchased. all the banks visited have faithful cashiers, and are thriving, some of them with prospects specially encouraging. macon, a branch recently opened, is a rich center of one of the best portions of the south; $1,000,000 was here, during the autumn and early winter, paid to freedmen for their share of last year's cotton ; a goodly portion of this sum has been deposited. a branch is strongly urged at lexington, ky. in that city i found 12,000 colored people, the most prosperous of any freedmen i have yet seen at the south. they generally own their own homes - three rooms, if of one story - and one hundred or more are of two stories. they are taxed on $250,000 of real estate, and are the well-paid cartmen, carriage drivers, and mechanics of the city. general g. s. goodloe, (a relative of henry clay,) wealthy and influential, introduced me to a number of similar gentlemen, all strong friends of our work. they made many inquiries, and desire our documents. i saw also leading colored men, who have heard well of our banks, and wish one in lexington. kentucky is full of ku-klux, who are specially roused by the fifteenth amendment; but the above men say a bank in lexington will be safe. these are a few illustrations of the general prosperity of this institution ; and yet i found the field around all our branches not half canvassed or cultivated. out-door work is everywhere called for, and the people should be constantly aroused and instructed on the subject. how best to do this is an important question. it occurs to me that, with increasing business, we shall at each branch respectively, though at different times, reach the point when the cashier will need a competent assistant, properly bonded. the cashier could then be out addressing the people, or visiting the surrounding rural population ; and thus, in my judgment, secure increased deposits more than sufficient to defray the added expense. as it is, however, the immediate prospect of a general increase of deposits, especially in the cotton regions, is very suspicious. although many are poor, the south is full of money from the large and high-priced crop, a good share of which is to go into the hands of colored men. in conclusion, permit me to say that no one can visit our branch institutions - note their progress, freedom hitherto from losses, increasing patronage and popularity - without astonishment. this institution has been the child of a protecting providence. if local committees are well chosen, cashiers of ability properly bonded and inspected, accounting in weekly reports accurately with our exchanges through the national banks and banking houses of our friends jay cooke & co., the system we have adopted seems as safe as anything of the kind of human affairs can be. the interest, also, which we allow depositors (all we can possibly make) will undoubtedly be increased by this advancing prosperity ; though the solid character of our government investments already make our triannual dividends, so far as i could learn, very satisfactory. j. w. alvord, president.

1870,3,31,1870033101204,New National Era,VA,origin and progress of the freedmen's savings bank,"the incorporation of the fsb, by act of congress, in the year 1865, marked an era in the history of four millions of people in a state of transition from personal chattelism to manhood and the privileges of citizenship: second only in importance to the proclamation of emencipation itself. the degree of manumission, we know, was the prohibition of slavery ; the establishment of the fsb became the greatest auxiliary of freedom. therein culminated the intellectual, industrial, social, and we may add, moral forces of the new life of enfranchisement ; for with the comprehension and acceptance of the principal of the acquisition of wealth, and the improvement and beautifying of material life, comes the primary lesson of freedom and progressive civilization. we all remember, that after emancipation became an irreversible fact, philanthropists and reformers of every shade of opinion, placed a temporary quietus on their antagonims, and united in devising means for ameliorating the physical condition of the freed people and providing for their education. we recall the unanimity of sentiment with which the north, by its magnanimous contributions, pronounced the work of intellectual and religious development among the freed slaves, the noblest and most stupendous charity of the nineteenth century. soon after the inauguration of measures to carry out the generous design of the people, through the medium of freedmen's commissions, rev. j. w. alvord, of boston - who had been engaged in supplying reading matter to the army, and in organizing the first schools for the freedmen - had the idea presented to him that a systematic method of including the people to save a portion of their earnings, and make such disposition of it as would conduce to their pecuniary interests, would prove highly subsidiary to the diffusion of knowledge. it was not merely rudimentary instruction in the seemingly trivial matters of every day existence as well: in the sagacity which foresees ; the discernment which perceives the relation of cause and effect: and in the conduct of life generally. no measures, however, were concerted for the embodiment of this conception until the year subsequent. mr. alvord thus concisely details the circumstances which incited him to put the scheme into execution, and the successive steps taken for its accomplishment: « in the winter of 1864, when on a tour south, i found that the military bank established by gen. r. saxton was doing excellent service, but still there were large sums of bounty money of colored troops left loosely in the hands of officers, who might or might not return it, or pay it to heirs in case the soldier fell in the field. at hilton head an officer showed me a trunk in which he had $75,000 of such money, and promised to have it deposited in a savings bank if permanently chartered by proper authority. i came north full of the idea and called together gentlemen in new york who agreed to take hold of the enterprise.  a charter was at first prepared for the new york who agreed to take hold of the enterprise. a charter was at first prepared for the new york legislature, but on going to washington i became satisfied that we could obtain a charter from the general government, which would be far better, and so reported to the friends in new york. on feb. 6th, 1865, rev. geo. whipple and myself were appointed a committee to visit the capital and confer with officers of the government on the subject. the result was that a bill was prepared with the aid of hon. henry wilson, which was passed by congress and signed by president lincoln. march 3nd. 1865. i remained in washington during the pendency of the bill - as it had to be watched and pushed forward - assisted by an occasional visit from mr. whipple, and the night of its passage was to me one of extreme anxiety. the bill was in the hands of mr. eliot of mass., and he had been on the alert all day for an opportunity to call it up. at 9 o'clock at night the speaker heard his voice and gave him the floor. the question of taking the bill from the table was carried on a call for the yeas and nays by only a single vote in the two-thirds majority required, and the previous question, in the midst of some confusion, at once carried the bill. messrs. sumner and wilson in the senate, with mr. eliot in the house deserve our grateful acknowledgments for their invaluable services. among the trustees mentioned in the act, are william c. bryant, peter cooper, gerrit smith, albert s. barnes, j. w. alvord, william claffin, a. a. low. george l. stearns, abbot lawrence, levi coffin, and forty others, all men eminent for financial ability or moral and literary excellence. these persons and their successors, were constituted a body corporate in the city of washington, in the district of columbia, by the name of the fsb, and by that name may sue and be sued in any court of the united states. in the securing of the charter, the great preliminary and essential step was taken, but very much remained to be done to make it operative: and to demonstrate to the people the practical advantages which must accrue to them from the success of the enterprise. no one could be sanguine enough to suppose that the mere fact that such an organization had been effected would be sufficient to ensure its prosperity and permanence ; that everything could be left to the instinct of the poeple, or to fortuitious circumstances. it was necessary that the subject be presented so simply and so cogently to the people that they would become convinced of its utility and special adaptation to their needs: necessary that their confidence in the beneficent character of the institution and the philanthropic prupose of the men who projected it should be won. besides the assistance guaranteed from the secretaries designated, the company was aided and encouraged in the prosecution of its work by the commissioner of the freedmen's bureau, general o. o. howard. he commended it to the military officers in all the states over which the jurisdiction of the bureau extended: offered every facility for the secretary and his assistants to travel through the south and communicate freely with the people ; and he officially appointed mr. alvord inspector of the financial affairs of the freedmen, with instructions to report to him what frauds may have been practiced upon the colored people, and also the most efficient means of securing their monied interests. the enterprise was now fairly afloat. although there was as yet nothing tangible to exhibit, the grand requisite was attained; the officers were, so to speak, en rapport with the people, and logic and common sense, and the intuitive perception which seldom leads a man to mistake or neglect his own interest, would do the rest. the first branch of the company was formed in washington, the national centre, from which an immense influence might radiate to render the organization of branches in other localities more feasible. the bank was reported to the trustees in june, 1865, as ready to begin operations, and its first deposit $24, was received the 11th of july. after the elapse of three months its aggregate deposits amounted to $4,425. this branch now holds $207,964.95. the operations of the company were further extended by the transfer to them of two other institutions of the nature of banks, but organized only by military authority. soon after the enlistment of colored troops was authorized by the government, general rufus saxton, military governor of south carolina, established at beaufort an institution for receiving the money of the soldiers, subject to their order. under his auspices this institution was of great service to the colored troops. a similar, but smaller, one was formed by general b. f. butler, at norfolk, virginia, about the same time. in july, 1865, the norfolk bank was transferred to the fsb; the balance of deposits being at that time $7,890, belonging to one hundred and eighty depositors. the beaufort bank was transferred december 14th of the same year by order of general saxton. this bank, which had been eminently successful under the cashiership of mr. samuel l. harris, the present financial inspector of the company, paid over the sum of $170,000. with the nucleous of nearly $180,000, though soon much reduced by the drafts of discharged soldiers, the company pushed forward its work with such energy and rapidity that it soon acquired a prestige and importance scarcely anticipated. branches were successfully established in the principal cities of the south and southwest, until there are now twenty-seven in operation, extending from washington to new orleans, and up the mississippi to st. louis. the financial statement of the company for february exhibits a sum total due depositors of $1,566,568.71, the whole amount received as deposits since its incorporation being $26,375,979.27. it seems almost incredible, when we reflect that this money has been accumulated from the meager earnings of a people but recently emerged from slavery, who were necessarily in a condition of extreme destitution, and who since their liberation have been subjected to a continuous system of fraud and pillage by their former masters. the condition of the company is highly prosperous. their assetts are increasing rapidly. they publish at washington, where the central office is located, a monthly paper entitled « the national savings bank », designed to promote the interest of the bank and to dissemmate information respecting it. the paper has a monthly circulation of 15,000 copies. the company is efficiently officered. its presidents is j. w. alvord; vice president, gen. o. o. howard; actuary col. d. l. eaton; general inspector. s. l. harris. twenty-seven of its officers are salaried and forty-six unsalaried. the probity and financial ability of the men at the central office must eventally, make the institution one of the most important monied organizations of the south."

1870,5,12,1870051201202,New National Era,VA,national savings bank. savannah branch,"the deposits in this branch having reached the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, a congratulatory meeting of the depositors and friends of the bank was held on wednesday evening, april 13th, in the second african baptist church. the exercises were of the most interesting character. the cashier's report of the rise and progress of the f. s. & t. company and of the savannah branch was listened to with deep interest*. the addition during the month of march of two hundred and sixty-one new depositors convinced all present that the bank had secured the hearty confidence of the colored people, and that its advantages were being appreciated. an interesting discussion sprang up between the speakers as to the most practicable method of investing the funds of the bank, so as to diffuse its blessings as generally as possible among the colored people. the weight of argument was evidently in favor of the present method - that of investing in united states securities. considering the peculiar condition and circumstances of the colored people, and their comparative poverty, that provision of the charter indicates the far-seeing wisdom of congress. by investing in government securities the bank is able to return deposits on demand. to a poor man this is great advantage. a colored man, a stranger in savannah, on his way to philadelphia, had ten dollars in a savings bank in boston. he wrote for the money, and after one week's notice the money was sent. during that week the poor man was waiting in savannah on expense, unable to proceed on his journey for the want of money. had that bank paid on demand as the f. s. & t. company always do, the stranger would have escaped the week's delay and expense. when circumstances shall plainly require a change in the mode of investing the funds of the company, congress will undoubtedly grant authority to make the change. the great point now for the colored people is to learn to save the pennies. he who never saves the pennies will never save the dollars. little by little we grow rich. i. w. brinckerhoff, cashier. *an interesting history of the origin, progress, and utility of savings banks, with a history of the national savings bank for colored people, prepared by the cashier of the mobile branch, may be had at the savannah branch. price, thirty cents.

1870,6,9,1870060901203,New National Era,VA,items from the branches - savannah branch,"one of the best indications at the present time of the future prosperity of the colored people in savannah, is the increasing desire in their minds for procuring a home for themselves. they really groan under the burden of high rents. many have already, with their savings in the bank, purchased a lot and built an inexpensive house ; and now when rent day comes, they realize that they are their own landlords. they have no fear of having their rent raised, nor of being obliged to vacate the premises. what a satisfaction to be able to say in your own house, these premises are mine. to have a home that he can call his own should be the ambition of every colored man. to accomplish this one must buy a lot and build a house. but this costs money. and surely it does. this need not, however, deter any. there is plenty of money, and almost every one has more or less of it. let those who have it spend no more than is necessary, and save all the balance. all that is saved weekly, or monthly, should be deposited in the savings bank. if it is kept at home there will be a constant temptation to spend it uselessly. besides, there will be great danger of having it stolen. many of our depositors have suffered loss in this way, until they wisely concluded that the savings bank is the safest place for their money. this branch continues to prosper. new depositors are constantly opening accounts on our books. i. w. brinckerhoff, cashier. "
1870,6,9,1870060901202,New National Era,VA,how the colored men are thriving,"one of the surest tests of the thrift or unthrift of a class of men is had by observing their use or non-use of the savings bank. this test it is very easy to apply to the colored people lately made free to manage their own concerns. in chattannooga, a branch of the national fsb was established about thirteen months ago. the freedmen themselves knew nothing of such things, and all the whites that despise or that hate the blacks made themselves very active in creating distrust of the bank and its manager. but in spite of all this, the business of the chattanooga branch has grown, and is now growing faster than ever before. a few weeks ago the cashier went down the alabama and chattanooga railway, among the colored laborers below gadsden, and in three days time received on deposit from them very near $5,000. if there are any white laborers and mechanics near chattanooga that are putting away as much cash as these freedmen, we should be glad to make it known. the short of it is, the freedmen are earning, are saving and are investing a great deal of money ; and the time is not very far ahead when they will be an extremely comforatble and well-to-do class.

1870,6,9,1870060901205,New National Era,VA,"annual report of the cashier of charleston branch national freedman's savings and trust company, presented at a meeting of the advisory committee held march 31, 1870. ","gentlemen: the termination of another fiscal year brings us again together to review our labors, and to present a summary of the transactions of this institution for the twelve months now past. at the last annual meeting we adverted to the favorable condition of our affairs, and indicated a belief in a larger success in the future, predicated upon the confidence which the institution had manifestly obtained in the minds of the community, particularly of that part of the community for whose benefit it was more especially established. this prosperity and this success have their realization, as the following tabular expose will certify. those to whose hands the daily working of the institution has been confided may justly regard it a matter of gratulation that so fair a result can be presented, while to the friends of the colored race elsewhere, who are watching the begnin and elevating influences attentant upon an experiment so suspiciously inaugurated, our achievements will afford high satisfaction, and will also prove the seeds of brighter hopes for the future. since our last annual meeting, by permission of the parent society, we have purchased at a moderate price and put in excellent order this building, which will henceforward be used by us. we have now a « local habitation » which, as well as a « name », will be permanent ; and which circumstance is a matter of considerable importance to the weal of the enterprise. situated, as it is, upon an eligible site and on a most desirable thoroughfare, with the growth of the city, the property must augment in value, and prove a valuable investment. to the members of the advisory committee, who are among the « men of substance », in the community, the cashier is under due obligation for their counsel, and for their uniform courtesy and zeal manifested in promoting the prosperity of the institution. the following is the statistical exhibit from march, 1869, to march, 1870: no. of depositors - due depositors. march 1869, 1,224 - $90,934.82. april 1869, 1,458 - $95,588.90. may 1869, 1,486 - $98,625.53. june, 1869, 1,532 - $98,787.19. july 1869, 1,589 - $104,684.77. august 1869, 1,645 - $110,227.91. september 1869, 1,730 - $107,753.78. october 1869, 1,797 - $107,109.13. november 1869, 1,923 - $116,971.97. december, 1869, 1,963 - $122,089.14. january 1870, 2,087 - $127,156.65. february 1870, 2,154 - $132,059.63. total interest paid to depositors: $6,180.10. the comparatively less deposits for september and october are believed to be justify due to the necessary uses for individual funds before the crops were ready for market. the large sums drawn from the deposits during the year, it is believed, have been transformed into lands and houses and homes - for those hitherto landless and homeless - and who are now grateful, not only that they are free from the chains of bondage, but are rejoicing in the certain rewards of industrial pursuits. nathan ritter, cashier. executive committee [list of names]"

1870,6,9,1870060901204,New National Era,VA,items from the branches - louisville branch,"the balance due 1,230 depositors at the end of april is over $98,000 - is steadily increasing, and before this meets the eye of the reader should not be considerable over $100,000 ; not nigh as much as some other branches, yet it is encouraging: it shows that our people are beginning to realize that in « the new order of things » it is absolutely essential to have money as a platform to stand upon, to build up the history of the race. what can any people do, what can they accomplish without money? every dollar saved in the bank speaks in thunder tones of progress - foresight - a happy future. there is no excuse for having no money. anyone can have a bank account ; and the beauty of it is, that it steadily increases - it grows as the seed planted by the river of waters, and will return a rich harvest. an effort is all that is required; once the resolution is formed, and, like the rubbing of aladin's fabled lamp, gold is yours. i was forcibly reminded of the power of united effort by a remark from a distinguished friend of mine, a close observer of nature and all surroundings, who, on seeing a tree uprooted by the storm, remarked that « it was the leaves that pulled that tree up by the roots - each leaf pulling at the same time in the same direction ». just so has this institution swelled up from a borrowed capital of seven hundred dollars to nearly $13,000,000 and a balance due depositors of one million seven hundred thousand dollars and more, all by united effort, all pulling in one direction. encouraging as is the « exhibit already, the future of this institution is to be a grand one » ; already is its power felt and acknowledged, but as time sweeps on, the balance multiplying month after month, it will assuredly be the greatest of the kind in the world. the colored people ought to feel proud of it; you can truly say it is « our bank » for it was started by friends for your special benefit. now, we desire to see our branch assume first-class proportions; we don't like to be behind anybody; we want to be even, anyhow, and until we are we will not rest satisfied. we ought to have $150,000 in our bank. all we want is an effort, pull together as the leaves in a storm, all in one direction, and we can soon have it. suppose the 20,000 persons here would all deposit ten cents a pice a day - 20,000 ten-cent pieces - $2000, a day! think of that! $12,000 a weel - $48,000 a month of four weeks! just think of that, and resolve that you will have a bank account; and resolve, second, yourself into a committee of one to impress your neighbor, all of your friends, of the importance of small savings; that in the new existence - for the old things are passed away, and all things are made new - it is your duty to yourself, your prosperity, and your country to be honest, economical, industrious in all the walks of life. horace morris, cashier."
1870,6,9,1870060901206,New National Era,VA,the good citizen,"we have, in the few years that this paper has been in existence, urged and begged our readers to save their earnings, to avoid extravagences in dress and living, to be prudent, to be virtuous, to be industrious and honest. our bank was not started as a mere money-making affair. it was a part of the great plan developed by that good man, general howard, as chief of the freedmen's bureau, to offer every aid, every inducement, and every opportunity for the colored man in his new position of citizen and freeman of this great nation, to gain an equality with his more favored brethren who had had so long start of him in the race of civilization. without some such agency to husband and protect his earnings, the colored man would have been the prey of designing and evil-minded persons, and might have lost all his savings, principal and interest. but the saving of earnings and the increase of capital were only means to an end. so fast as there means were gathered so fast was a part of the foundation laid for solidly reconstructing our new society. knowledge is power - and so is money. the one is a radical element, and the other a conservative. unitedly, they work very well together. it is not the man who knows everything who is the best citizen, nor yet the richest man who is the best citizen. we esteem him the best citizen who contributes most for the general advantage of the community. of course some men, better endowed with natural gifts than others, can do more than their fellows who are less favored. but each man has his place and his own peculiar work to do, and he can do that well, be it small or great. we shall not cease our exhortations to save, to buy homesteads, and to live virtuously ; but we propose now to call our readers' attention to the homely virtue of good citizenship. in our columns will be found discussions of the best crops for the different belts of soil or climate in the southern states. we shall explain by others' contributions « how to grow tea », and treat of the « china grass », and gather statistics about cotton and sugar and the gold fields in the carolinas. but we do not thereby propose that all our readers shall go into these various pursuits and schemes. contentment is a great element of success. « patience and perseverance », says the old proverb, « does the work always ». it is these qualifications that acomplish everything, move mountains, bridge valleys, build railroads, and open up avenues of trade and commerce. the ability to do comes not from the mere accident of a man's position. the individuals in florida, with his chance at orange growing, should not repine that he is not surrounded by the gold mountains of the carolinas, or sugar plantations of louisiana. not that one is to fall asleep in indolence, and say whatever is is best. we mean that contentment which comes from patient industry, always doing, steady progress, which works hard and sleeps sound, which loves home, family and children, which is not eager for change or novelty, which is ready for every duty that belongs to the citizen, the christian, the parent, or the child. the wealth of a state or a nation does not mainly consist in its dollars, its metals, its crops, its manufactories, its fields, or its material resources, but in its virtuous, industrious, independent, contended citizens. such men will best handle and best develope all natural forces, and build up the strongest nation.

1870,7,7,1870070701212,New National Era,VA,mayor martin on the freedman's savings bank.,"the following report of an address made by his honor mayor martin, at a meeting of the friends of the fsb at wilmington, n. c., jan. 26th, 1870, will be read with pleasure. we only regret that our space obliges us to condense it somewhat: we had hoped to find room for every word of it: this bank is chartered by the congress of the united states, it is the only bank (national) in existence with such a charter. the bank with all its branches, scattered throughout the southern states, was specially designed to aid the colored people to save their earnings and to give them for that object a bank whose credit would be undoubted, making the provision that allt he deposits on hand should be invested in the bonds of the government. the deposits are thus disposed of, the interest accruing on them being appropriated strictly to payment of expenses and dividends. « the colored people, at the termination of the war, had but little of this world's goods. accustomed to habits of extravagance, eugendered by the condition of slavery, they progressed very slowly in accumulating money. impulsive by nature, unaccustomed to freedom, they made no effort to lay up a store for the future of their lives and those to come after. the benevolent government of our country came forward and created this « national savings bank », hoping thereby to induce habits of economy, thrift and self-dependence, in those to whom it had extended the great blessings of liberty. the success of the bank is shown in the fact that nearly one and a third millions of dollars are now in its hands. as i have said, the anxious desire to add the colored people in their efforts to secure independence was the key to the establishement of this « national fsb ». its efforts so far have been rewarded, yet, much remains to be done upon the part of those for whom this bank was established. the first great want is economy, and an awakening to the knowledge of the power and value of money. a man without any money is but the servant of others ; he is without the power to choose his occupation, his employer, or the duration of his labor. he must submit to the exactions of every body for whom he works. he is no longer a freeman, because the unrelenting power of hunger, thirst and cold, compel him to uncongenial labor. i have no doubt many here present made up their minds long ago that they could not have anything. i have heard many seemingly wise people assert with great earnestness that they could not save anything. it is the common answer to the question, « why don't you save some money? ». i have taken a great deal of time to investigate the subject, and have in every case, where the answer came from an able bodied man, been able to disprove his assertion. i have seen men live comfortably on $300 per year and keep out of debt. i have seen their income suddenly increased to $600, or perhaps $1000, and at the end of the year they would be just as poor as when receiving $300. now, any man can figure on this, and is ready to exclaim with me, « why, if he can live on $300, don't he save the balance? ». now, that is the idea i want to get you to adopt and follow out. it is a simple sum in arithmetic. in most cases the increased pay goes into extravagances and luxuries which are more injury than good. looking at it from one point of view, the man whose receipts are thus increased is not one cent better off ; he has only been able to disburse a little more money, which has passed through his hands, doing him no more benefit than the money of a bank or other corporation does the cashier through whose hands it passes. it is hard to begin. i know how longignly a poor man looks forward to the luxury of indulgence in something his means has not heretofore allowed him. i know how hopefully every mother looks forward to the time when she may vie with her neighbors in the dress and adornment of her children ; so, when a little addition to the income arrives, it is already mentally spent. this is all wrong. instead of these extravagant outlays, this money, and every cent possible from every other source, should not be saved, put at interest and become a permanent blessing. the time comes in every man's and woman's life when the follies of fashion end, and the sober realities of life are everywhere about them. then what a comfort will it be to know that we denied ourselves and saved by it a home and comfort. one of the first questions asked by a person who wishes to put their money in a bank is: « is it safe? ». i have no doubt many of you have heard the question asked in regard to our bank. i am glad of this public opportunity to answer it. i believe you will be satisfied that i tell you the truth - and i tell you that it is safe. safe as the government of the united states, in whose bonds all the surplus is invested. the branch here, and all the branches everywhere, are responsible for their deposits. they have now a considerable surplus - i think could pay every dollar due to depositors and have nearly one hundred thousand dollars left. it is managed by upright men ; men of the highest character, and of national reputation. if a bank was robbed or destroyed, your money would still he safe. if a few years more shall roll round and our bank shall not have prospered to the extent of treble its present amount of deposits, then i shall have to acknowledge that i am disappointed, and that the colored people are not prospering as they ought. i am sure there are some within my hearing who have been benefitted by this bank. numbers of houses and homes have been secured by those who, for a few months, have saved their few dollars every week. i appeal to them to come up and help us. every man, woman, and child can do something in the way of explaining, urging, talking, and acting. do it, my friends ; work with energy and will. it is one of the best works you ever engaged in ».

1870,7,14,1870071401201,New National Era,VA,financial statement of the national freedmen's savings and trust company,[see image for the report] 
1870,7,14,1870071401203,New National Era,VA,the new freedman's bank.,"material prosperity, as a rule, is consequent upon moral or mental elevation. the vicious heathen grovels in filth and discomfort. in highly moral and christian communities we find everywhere physical evidences of thrift and comfort. the intemperate, uncivilized indian is content with his wigwaum and blanket, whilst his civilized neighbord seeks to surround himself with all the material appliances and luxuries of life. with the former imprudence and laziness are the parent of want and misery, whilst the conduct of the latter is characterized by providence and thrift. the barbarities of slavery depressed the colored people of america to the lowest state of moral and physical existence. but freedom and education are developing in them all those virtues that characterize races or nations who are guaranteed by just laws and impartial legislation all their heaven bestowed rights. the far-sighted friends of the colored people felt throughout the struggle that eventuated in the bestowal upon them of the privilege and immunities they now possess, that they would prove no exception to the rule, that the influences of freedom would develop in them all those virtues that distinguish white men in the enjoyment of the same blessings. in that belief, we say with pride and gratification, they have not been disappoint. on every side we are greated by evidences of their moral and material progress. they display ability and zeal in contributing, by the indepedent cultivation of our southern staples, to the productive wealth of the country. at the close of the war, when the south was in almost a chaotic state, when the country resounded with most dismal croakings over the future of the colored people, when even some of their tried friends doubted their ability, under the then adverse circumstances, to sustain themselves against the tide of depressing influences that set so strongly against them, there were men who, from long intimacy with their character and capacity, cherished the firmest convictions of their success in the new relations, which the events of the war had brought about. foremost amongst them was j. w. alvord, the president of the fsb. when he first broached his intention of inaugurating this institution, he was met on all sides with discouragement and prognostications of failure. firmly relying, however, on the estimate he had formed from a long experience of the thrift and capacity of the colored prople, he never faltered in his intention ; and the success that has crowned his exertion marks him as a real benefactor to the people his efforts in this direction have so well served to elevate. from its commencement, until the present the course of this institution has been one of uninterrupted prosperity. from a small beginning at washington it has ramified its influence throughout the principal cities of the south, and almost every weel brings a demand for a branch institution from some southern centre of industry, that a safe deposit may be had fort the surplus means the former poverty-stricken slave is now enabled to save from the rewards of his unremifting industry and praise-worthy economy. so extensive has this institution become, and so prudent and profitable has been its management, that it has been now found necessary to erect for its convenience a bank building, which, places as it will be, in one of the finest part of our national capital, will prove an ornament to the city, and a monument to the wisdom and foresight of the projectors of the company. this corporation has just entered into a contract with robert j. henry, esq. to erect for them on the land they have purchased, on the northeast corner of fifteenth street and pennsylvania avenue, a magnificent building, at a cost of $58,823. the architects, messrs. starkweather & plowman, have submitted a design, which the company have accepted. it is not intended that the bank shall occupy the whole of the premises, a portion will be used for stores. it is also the determination of some wealthy and public spirited individuals, whose names are a guarantee of success, to build on the other portions of the same land, a hotel, to rival the arlington in spaciousness and splendor. its architectural design will so harmonize with that of the bank as to give the whole the appearance of one magnificent structure. truly we live in a changeful age. who would have been so rash ten years ago, as to have prophesied that the colored people, then in a state of abject slavery and destitution, regarded as degraded and incapable, would within a decade, through their industry in the condition of freemen, contribute by their prudent thrift, so fine and structure to the adornment of the capital of the nation, that se scorned and oppressed them. "
1870,7,14,1870071401202,New National Era,VA,thrift amongst colored men,"it used to be one of the arguments most confidently and flippantly proclaimed in justification and defense of slavery, that negroes were naturally an idle and improvident set, and that if set at liberty they could not support themselves, and would starve. and this argument in favor of the accursed institution was made in the face of the great truths that for generations they had not only supported themselves, but the many millions of white people of the south. since the war the old advocates of slavery have been equally confident that they would only work under the lash, and must become paupers and criminals. notwithstanding the accumulation of evidence that they will and do work even better, where ordinary fair play is shown them, for themselves or their employers than for their owners. the fruits of their industry are everywhere to be seen in the agricultural and other statistics of the country, and they are daily proving the falsehood of their enemies in alleging, that under freedom they would surely sink to a lower deep of poverty and degradation than any other class of our laboring population ever did. the general industrial and economical habits begat by their freedom finds its aptest illustration in the fact, that the « national fsb », in its various branches, has on deposit at this time about two millions of dollars, the fruit of their hard toil. the amount of deposits for the month of may was $522,364.47. can the « poor whites » of the south present any such evidence of industry and thrift on their part? where are their savings banks and trust companies?"

1870,7,28,1870072801208,New National Era,VA,items from the branches. chattanooga branch. how the national savings bank was advertised.,"once the cashier of the chattanooga branch of the savings bank was down along the line of the alabama and chattanooga railroad. at the earnest request of the able and efficient superintendent of the road, who is a true friend to all the better interests of his employees, the  said cashier was striving to interest the men in the savings bank, but being a stranger to the great majority of them, he found it no small task to get even a single depositor in a squad. but remembering that perseverance often overcomes great obstacles, he passed on from squad to squad, handing out bills and cards to those who could read, and saying to the foreman that the « walking boss » had said if any one wished to deposit, he could drop his pick and do so. still the depositors were very few. among these workmen each squad has a leader who gives orders when to fill and when to start to empty wheel-barrows. presently the cashier came to one of these squads, whose leader, a virginian, knew something of the savings bank at richmond. he had also seen and conversed with the cashier at chattanooga, and just as this cashier was approaching his squad he sung out « away to the dump, away ». that was the beginning ; the gang deposited well, and still continues to do well. now many of the foremen on the road, as well as many of the business men alnog the line of the road, are finding out about the « savings bank » and making use of it. chattanooga is rapidly improving, and every day our prospects brighten. the colored people expect to have before long not only a bank, but also a neat and well arranged brick academy. e. o. tade, cashier."

1870,7,28,1870072801211,New National Era,VA,items from the branches. st. louis branch.,"it may be interesting to many of the patrons of their branch to note the progress made from its organization to the present. it first opened its doors for business on the 29th day of june, 1868. the first deposit received was from an aged lady, amounting to $20. this circumstance was considered auspicious ; she had faith in the permanence and stability of the institution, though she knew nothing of its history or management. the progress has been regular and steady. during the first eighteen months there was an average gain of $1,407.31 per month. for the six months ending july 1, 1870, the net gain has been $25,000, or one hundred per cent. the balance at the principal office to the credit of this branch at the time of this writing is more than $50,000. as gratifying as is this result, it has not been attained without effort, and in the face of many things calculated to discourage. the thirty-nine savings and other banks in st. louis, among the best in the country, have all had a liberal share of the patronage of the colored people. our bank has had to compete with these older and well established institutions, and has gradually ingratiated itself into the confidence of the people. « the rubicon has been passed », and we now feel assured of a grand success. a recent flying visit from our excellent actuary, colonel eaton, foreshadows a new era with us. we are on the eve of removing into our new banking room, one of the best locations in the city. we are ambitious or closing the year with a balance to our credit at the principal office of one hundred thousand dollars. a union of effort is all that is required to attain this end. we ask our friends to see that they use their best endeavors to increase the influence of this great institution. willis h. brent, cashier."
1870,7,28,1870072801210,New National Era,VA,items from the branches. beaufort branch.,"the prospect for the colored people on the « sea islands » this season seem unusually flattering. i have made careful enquiry of residents from the different islands and have made personal examination of many crops, and the stand for cotton is better than it has been for many years. provisions also are looking highly favorably. another encouraging fact is, that the colored farmers are working better, more steadily and with more systematic skill than ever before. they are improving their farms, using more extensively manures and phosphates and purchasing more stock to help them in their work: so that from present appearances they will receive a bountiful harvest. all this of course takes money and for these purposes they have drawn somewhat largely of their savings in the bank, as is generally the case through the spring. while all with commendabl;e pride, praise the favorable appearance of their crops, due in such great measure to their own personal exertions, they with equal unanimity assert, that now as they are getting out of debt and farehanded with the world, and as the bank has to that end been of so much assistance to them, they are going to save every dollar they can from their crops and « bank it » ; for - they say - « it takes a little money to make money ; and i may want some, to start crop next year ». we trust this hopeful resolution will be universally adhered to. there is no reason why the majority of our farmers should not each deposit $100 or more from the proceeds of this year's crops as many have done from their crops of last season. in this way our deposits would easily be doubled, as indeed they should be. friends and depositors think seriously of this, and, as it should be, resolve that it shall be. nelson r. scovel, cashier."

1870,7,28,1870072801205,New National Era,VA,items from the branches. norfolk branch.,"one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) on deposit in our bank at norfolk. our balance due depositors is just a little above these figures to day, july 1, 1870, and we are all rejoicing in our great success, as well in the success of so many whose little fortunes this sum represents. when the severity of the present dull and hard times wears away, there is no reason why we should not have twice or three times this amount on deposit. norfolk is sure to be a great city. capitalists are striving to get the great western railroad in operation with norfolk as its eastern terminus, and it now seems quite probable they will succeed, in which cae, with plenty of work for the laborer, and the immense increase of business of all kinds, our colored friends here will surely have « piles » of money to save ; and the national fsb, if it keeps its present reputation, is very sure to receive it on deposit. h. c. percy, cashier.

1870,9,29,1870092901204,New National Era,VA,items from the branches. new york branch.,"the heavy expense of living in our city, makes it difficult for the people to save much from their earnings without the utmost care and prudence in the management of household affairs. this many had already learned, but the establishment and growth of our bank, although slow, has nevertheless extended the list of such persons, and inspired new hope and promises in the minds of our youth, and beckons them forward to new aspirations. the habit of saving - prudence in expenditude, and lofty aim and purpose, are the lessons we endeavor to teach ; and now more extensively than ever before, we shall spread before the people these and similar lessons. a large amount of money necessarily passes through the hands of the people of all classes living in the city, and if but a little of the amount needlessly spent, were saved, it would amount to many hundred thousand dollars in a few years. the fact that about two hundred and forty-thousand dollars has been deposited with this bank, completes the argument, that our national company, with fifteen millions of dollars in deposits, is beginning to be better appreciated and that the people are beginning the foundation for future self reliance. money, it must be admitted, cannot take the place of character or intelligence ; but that the possession of money is one of the great powers of the nation, and one of the foundation stones of social progress, must also be admitted. oppression and disfranchisement entailed distrust and waste ; we believe that liberty and equality of rights should work out mutual confidence, and prudent consideration for the future. if these views can be successfully pressed upon the attention of the people, it ought to yield at least forty thousand dollars during the fall. john j. zuille, cashier.

1870,11,10,1870111001201,New National Era,VA,letters from the people,"raleigh, n. c., oct. 28, 1870. to the editor of the new national era: the fsb. this institution is doing a great work in educating the colored people of this section, and of the south generally, wherever its branches have been established, to habits of industry, economy, and thrift. no agency yet employed has worked more perceptibly in this direction than the savings bank. we had the pleasure of attenting a meeting at the court-house here on friday night last (28th october) when it was announced that rev. j. w. hood, assistant superintendent of public instructions for this state, would deliver a lecture, or an address, in the interest of this worthy enterprise. in point of numbers the audience was not so large as might have been desired, though the room was well filled. we were somewhat disappointed, in consenence of the illness of mr. hood, on account of which he was compelled to decline. however, none regretted having come out, as the meeting was very ably adressed by john r. caswell, esq., one of our county commissionners, and a member of the advisory board of the bank. mr. caswell presented the claims of the bank in a manner and with a characteristic earnestness which can but result in good fot the bank and people. after mr. caswell had concluded, the well-known cashier, rev. g. w. brodie, addressed the meeting in his usual forcible manner, showing to the entire satisfaction of all present the great necessity of saving and depositing their earnings in the bank, assuring them of perfect safety, and how he accumulates when placed on deposit. he told them that the subject then being discussed stood second in importance to none but their freedom. the audience seemed much interested as the cashier made plain the great advantages of the bank, concluding his remarks with a report showing the condition of the branch and company, which we give, as follows: number of branches, 29 ; three of which are located in this state  the wilmington, newbern and raleigh. total amount deposited in all the branches up to the 1st of september, 1870 : $15,990,661.18. total amount of drafts for the same period : $13,949,590.83. leaving a balance due depositors of : $2,041.35. total amount deposited in the raleigh branch during the month of september: $5,062.04. total amount of drafts for same period: $6,504.04. total amount of drafts for same period: $6,504.53. it will be seen that the drafts for the month exceed the deposits some $1,442.49, which is mainly due to the fact that many persons who had been depositing ever since the commencement of the good work up to that time had amassed a sufficient amount of cash to enable them to purchase comfortable homes, and otherwise provide themselves with the necessaries of life. total amount deposited in raleigh branch: $95,171.97. total drafts: $80,186.79. leaving a balance due depositors: $14,985.18. the number of depositors to which this amount is due, 778. this, mr. editor, speaks well for the colored people of this city, numbering something over 3,000. this branch went into operation april, 1868, if we mistake not, which, taking all things into consideration, show, according to the above figures, that this branch has done more business than many of the older branches, and as much as any of the twenty-nine. much credit is due the cashier, mr. brodie, for this grand result. but for his untiring efforts in creating confidence in the bank, and inducing the people to deposit, much of the $14,000 now safely invested in government securities would have been hidden in the earth, or chincked away in some obscure corner of the house, and much, very much, of it would have been foolishly spent. we believe no one could have worked with greater success among our people than mr. brodie has. ever since his advent among us he has devoted himself almost wholly to the moral, intellectual, and industrial advancement of his race. his work is to be seen and felt for miles around. not having participated to any great extent in politics, he has grown in favor with all classes, both white and black ; and today no man stands, higher in the estimation of the people of raleigh than george washington brodie.

1871,1,12,1871011200204,Louisianian,Louisiana,shreveport freedmen and their thrift,"it is gratifying to one’s mind to receive acknowledgements of merit from unexpected quarters; and it is still more pleasing if the approbation is of conduct that is really praise worthy. in november last, the national savings bank, established a branch in shreveport. the people there, for whose especial benefit the institution is inaugurated, so largely availed themselves of the advantage of laying up their little treasure, that the cadde gazette of dec. 3, gives the following favorable notice of the matter. “we learn that already over three thousand dollars have been deposited in the freedman’s saving bank established in our city. when we take into consideration the scarcity of money, and that this bank has been in operation only two weeks, it gives assurance of its future success. the freedmen, just emerged from slavery, and having in former years masters whose duty and interest alike required them to provide for the wants of their slaves, are improvident from habit. the plan upon which these banks are organized precludes the possibility of failure, provided the national credit is maintained, and those who manage them have the qualification and integrity to conduct these institutions in conformity with the act of congress authorizing their organization. as we desire the happiness and prosperity of the african race, and hope they may become an educated and an independent people, through their industry and economy, we wish them all success in their efforts to devise ways and means by which they may save their hard earnings and get interest on the same. the first lesson to be learned in life, is the proper use of money, and the sooner the freedmen realize the fact to their future success depends upon their own exertions, the better it will be for them and for us. every man must become self-reliant, before he can become self-supporting, and to accomplish that most desirable result he must be willing to make temporary sacrifices for ultimate rewards. he must restrain his appetites and exercise that self-control which is the high distinguishing characteristic of a rational being.”"

1871,1,12,1871011201201,New National Era,VA,letter from shreveport. la.,"shreveport, la., dec, 23, 1870. to the editor of the new era: the last time i saw you was in the city of dayton, ohio, and the impressions of your last visit to that city i presume you have not forgotten, neither have i. since then i have emigrated to the south land, and now reside as indicated by the caption of this article. i came here in august last, and since then i have seen many manifestations of the peculiar modes of southern life. i was here during the late political compaign, the peculiar features of which i shall reserve for a future article. i am now at the head of the fsb, just established here, and i am increasing my general fund of practical knowledge of human nature very much in my new capacity. there is no place in the south where the bank is more needed than here. mrs. stowe was right in making this red river valley the mythic home of the legrees. it is a pity and a shame to learn of the large sums of money out of which the colored people are constantly being cheated. a certain class of traders here will pull, tease, and beg the colored men into their stores to buy cheap goods, and the ignorant freedmen trade at the losing rate of a $100 bill for $10 ; $50 for $5. i have known freedmen, after selling their cotton and buying everything they could think of, to throw down a $50 bill and ask what they could get for it. his fear was that some man would eat his throat if he knew he had it. the money is here, and is plentifully made, but it will take labor to save it. the bank is opposed with intense earnestness and bitterness, and will have to endure the sieges of a regular campaign before it will win. i have been greatly encouraged by many examples of industry and sacrifice on the part of the colored people to lift themselves above their evil surroundings. for their encouragement, i wish to publish in the era, from time to time, some of these notable eases, doubting not but others may be inspired with such examples of industry and sacrifice. the lady with whom i am boarding, mrs. coursey, (freed by the war) has by her own unassisted industry and economy bought and paid for a home worth $3,000. « uncle charley » is a noble old hero. he came down the street the other day driving a good team, and when in front of the bank the following conversation ensued: « gentlemen, mules cost money, and my wood must sell for money. i bought these mules to farm with when i hadn't bread in the house ». i looked at him, and he repeated it with emphasis, cracked his whip, and drove on. i thought of the noble spirit of that man, and that to such men we owe a debt of gratitude for their bright examples of the success and enterprise of our race. mr. cole, one of our business men, married three years ago. he gave to his wife a mexican dollar, and said: « wife, this is all i have got. keep this and see what we can add to it ». today this couple own ten acres of good land, and all the implements and stock with which to farm. milly gaines, a widow, paying house-rent, and supporting five children, is one of our regular depositors. while orthers are doubting the bank and wasting money, these are saving their money, and now are decidedly on the winning side of life. doubtless this will be true to too great an extent till the great disparity between the two classes shall be revealed, as it will be in the course of one, three, or five years. our best men will gather round the bank as their strongest hope, and the main contest will be at the beginning. let our people everywhere be encouraged, by these and other examples numerous enough, to be industrious and saving, sacrificing luxury, pride, or anything else that may tempt them to spend a dollar or a dime aside from the actual necessities of life. yours truly, samuel peters."

1871,1,19,1871011901202,New National Era,VA,"the freedman's savings bank at jacksonville, fla.","washington, d. c., jan. 16, 1870. to the editor of the new national era: sir: having recently returned from a tour through the seaboard southern states, particularly that of florida, and having seen many things which interested and often surprised me, i have thought that it would be well to communicate to the reading public some of the impressions made on my mind, in the hope of doing good. i have chosen first your paper, because what i write concerns particularly a class of our father's children who have for ages been kept back from advancement under the light of civilization, and because i desire to spread far and wide the fact that the course of that much-wronged race is now, thank god! both upward and onward. when at jacksonville, florida, i was made acquainted, through a letter of introduction from col. d. l. eaton, actuary of the fsb, washington, d. c., with c. s. coan, esq., cashier of the jacksonville branch of the fsb, i was received (as also my friend, e. b. george, esq., who accompanied me on my tour) by mr. coan with that whole-souled kindness and courtesy which appear to be a part of his natureé among other objects of interest i was shown, by mr. coan, the new building designed as a banking-house for the branch of the fsb at jacksonville, florida. in company with that faithful officer of the bank i went entirely over and throughout the building, and was enabled, through his kindness, to inspect the plans, elevations, &c., as well as the character of the materials of workmanship, of this the first banking institution that has ever been built in jacksonville, florida. the dimensions are as follows: lenght, 65 feet ; breadth, 65 feet. first story, 13 feet 9 inches high, clear of jost, &c. ; second story, 12 feet high ; and the third story, which is designed as a public hall, where lectures, concerts, &c., may be given, is 12 feet high to the top of the cornice and main wall, and by the french (mansard) roof 12 feet more are added ; to which 7 feet more is gained in the centre by the rise of the roof - making the hall 27 feet high in the centre, and 24 feet at the sides. handsome and convenient galleries will be put up on three sides, thus adding at least one half to the number of seats in the hall, or to a total of 1,000. this will also be the pioneer hall in jacksonville, and of the existence of which the community will have cause to rejoice. the second story is that which will be occupied by the banking and other offices. the first story will be occupied by stores of the first class. in the whole arrangement, and in every detail, there seems to have been nothing left out that could give strenght, security, solidity, and convenience to the various objects comprehended in the design ; while the beauty of the structure would add to the appearance of any city in our land. the building is located advantageously in the business part of the city, and its offices would be the best that could be secured for the use of the united states government business, as those now occupied are inadequate for the purposes required. mr. c. l. coan has devoted his whole time that could be spared from his official duties (wherein he is ably assisted by the energetic assistant cashier, mr. f. e. little) to the personal inspection of the work. he has had every timber and brick, from foundation to top of the roof, set in its place under his own eye, and has used none but the very best of all kinds of materials. i fear he has presumed too far with his energies, thus visibly affecting his health and greatly debilitating him ; but he is determined to finish his work if he lives, or at least to leave no cause for complaint in case he should have a successor. i have been thus explicit for the reason that i desire to let all business men and persons of economical habits know that there is a safe place for the deposits they may desire to make, where a fair interest will be paid, and that the national fsb is gaining strength daily, and stands in the first place on a sure foundation.  very respectfully, yours, &c., captain wm f. crane.

1871,6,1,1871060100202,Semi-Weekly Louisianian,Louisiana,the advantages of a bank,"last week there walked into the freedmen’s saving bank a colored gentleman who deposited a considerable amount of money. the money was in greenbacks, and had lost that peculiar smell which bears testimony to its constant handling. the cashier of the bank noticed this fact at once, and the fact came out that the recent murder of mrs. zollinger in this city, which was perpetrated to obtain the money it was known they kept in their house had awakened fears that those who keep their money in the house not only run the risk of losing it but they invite assaults upon their lives. some people doubt the safety of banks because in the olden time banks used to break with a wonderful regularity and convenience to the rich controllers who simply took this method of cheating poor depositors. but in the case of the freedmen’s savings bank there is no possibility of loss, for the reason that the government of the united states is responsible for every dollar deposited. when therefore, one moment’s reflection is given to the subject it will be seen that to keep money in the house, when once the habit of saving has been formed, is to run the risk of its being lost by fire, in case of the burning of the house, and to solicit the visits of burglars, who to carry out their purposes of theft will even commit murder. only last week $900 was lost by a fire in gretna and the murder to which we have referred when added show the dangers of keeping money in the house when a safe bank is accessible. we earnestly call the attention of out people to these facts, not only because of the habit of saving which depositing in a bank begets, but because of the safety of the money deposited, and the lives which may be spared by it. as a proof that our people are giving more attention to these matters, we may mention that the new orleans branch of the freedmen’s saving bank, under the management of its able cashier, mr. sturtevant has had its deposits increased over $52 000 since january last."

our balance on the 1st of january was $163,203 97; on the 1st of february, $168,216 66; on the 1st of march, $200,962 81; on the 1st of april, $228,970 80; on the 1st of may, $236,358 06; on the 1st of june, $246,001 85. our gain since january 1st is $82,797 88, being an increase of over 50 per cent. 
during this time we have had over 559 new depositors, and the laboring people are every day learning the great advantages of saving their money and placing it at interest in this bank.
our old depositors have drawn out since january 1st, over $25,000 for the purpose of building houses, buying building lots, drays, mules, and other property. this money has all been saved in small sums, and these men, who were once so poor and needy, are now independent and live beneath their own roofs. something over four years ago a colored man came into the bank saying, “i’m going to try and save something,” and deposited $8. this man was earnest, and every week a portion of his earnings were put into the bank. to-day he owns two cottages and is building a third one. one of these houses he keeps for his own use and the other he rents for $18 per month. another man, who follows the trade of bootblack, has over $1,800 in the bank, money he has saved since he was a soldier in the united states army. every laboring man in the state can have a home of his own if he will only learn to save the dimes. “take care of the dimes and the dollars will take care of you.” this adage is as true as the gospel.
to the press of new orleans and vicinity our thanks are due for their generous aid in bringing the true objects of this bank before the public. very truly yours, c. d. sturtevant, cashier. – savings bank.

1871,10,5,1871100501204,New National Era,VA,now and then.,"one of the most successful institutions in this city is the fsb. following emancipation and universal suffrage, it is one of the wonders of the age, and while it has dumbfounded the philosophy and ethics of the enemies of the colored man, it has also contributed a compliment to the policy of the republican party that no political organization has earned since the foundation of civil liberty. when we look back over a period of fifteen years and contemplate the terrible prejudice that then existed in all sections of the country against the colored man, with slavery as its corner signe, and compare it with the condition of affairs now, the proportion of the contrast is almost beyond human explanation. there is no wonder that fred. douglass in his expression of exaltation a few months ago, explained, with such pathetic emotions, his appreciation of the change in the following beautiful language: « ah, gentlemen, who shall tell the story of the past. i cannot. to me all is changed: and what an unuiterable, indescribable change! from slavery to liberty, from ostracism to equality, from ignorance to self respect, from sin to schools, from the lash to the light, from the bludgeon to the bailot, from a country bound in chains to a nation robed in glory, from a capital that seemed to be rooted in despotism to a great city, free and wholesome and beneficent. find your orator to tell us of these marvels. i have no speech to describe, though my heart cherishes them all ». while douglass shrank from a speech to describe the moral and political change, who is it that will undertake to trace its influences upon all the other relations of life? so complete is the victory that we are sometimes almost persuaded to doubt that slavery ever existed, or that the black man in this country ever had a past different from our own. in looking, the other day, at the magnificent architectural pile of the fsb, we could not resist these reflections, and compare the difference between that structure and the appearance of rigg's bank, on the corner below. as a friend remarked, pointing with his finger, « the one is young, and the other old, civilization ». but it teaches a lesson of more value than that to the business interests of this district, for while one favors progress the other dwarfs it, and with its miserly earnings contributes to the injury of our future. one of the main dependents of the « obstructionists », we are told is furnished by that institution, which owes its existence to the fostering care of an indulgent government and the generous support of the people of washington ; and, we are also well informed, that the taxes on the new building of the fsb will amount to more than all the improved property owned by the principal manager of the bank referred to. which of these two institutions is of the most value to our city, and to which are the people most indebted? the past has already answered it, and the future will more than justify the preference. we have referred to this contrast simply to callt he attention of the people to the difference between our friends and ennemies. - sunday chronicle.

at this critical moment a consultation took place in the private library of salmon p. chase – then our secretary of the treasury, now our chief justice – to consider “how we could take care of the contraband,” or rather “how we could best teach the freedmen to take care of themselves.” it ended under secretary chase’s advice in asking congress to grant to peter cooper and others, a charter to establish in washington a central savings bank for freedmen; with branches all through the country, just as fast as american soil should be rescued for freedom. 
this was the first great provision made by the republic for its helpless millions of freedmen whom the crazy shot into fort sumpter had launched into our hands. it was right to do this, because it is always right to do right. i was kind to do it, because the south was her own enemy – not ours; and in her weakness she needed our strength; in her hate, if she had it – our love. so all praise be to salmon, p. chase, peter cooper, jay cooke and h.d. cooke, and everybody who helped the good act along – all praise to the congress which gave the charter, and “all glory be to god and henry of navarre.” we only pay this passing tribute to the noblest american of his country – abraham lincoln – for his heart dictated and his hand wrote that eternal proclamation of freedom.
this noble charter for freedmen’s savings banks was the first relay house of the african on his road to independence. it was his district school. it taught him the great lesson, that every free man who will work, can make more money than he needs, and save the balance against a rainy day. and the good work went on. savings banks were opened wherever the old flag was set floating over redeemed soil, and now we have this record. we insert the list of freedmen’s savings banks as they were founded, and every one of which is now doing its good work: atlanta, ga. augusta, ga. baltimore, md. beaufort, s.c. charleston, s.c. chattanooga, tenn. columbus, miss. columbia, tenn. huntsville, ala. jacksonville, fla. lexington, ky. little rock, ark. louisville, ky. lynchburg, va. macon, ga. memphis, tenn. mobile, ala. montgomery, ala. natchez, miss. nashville, tenn. newbern, n.c. new orleans, la. new york city, n.y. norfolk, va. philadelphia, pa. raleigh, n.c. richmond, va. savannah, ga. shreveport, la. st. louis, mo. tallahasse, fla. vicksburg, miss. washington, d.c. wilmington, n.c.
thus like a ministering angel, the savings banks followed close in the track of the freedmen – recalling, although reserving the sublime imagery of an elder nation who were led by “a pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by night,”
“when angels walked in israel’s van.”
it is beyond the compass of human calculation to estimate the good which these savings banks have done for the colored race. none but the all-seeing eye has looked upon, none but the all-knowing mind can comprehend it. 
the conversations of that evening in the house of mr. chase will not soon be forgotten. the heavy storm-cloud of the war had not yet cleared away. the republic was still struggling like a lacoon in the folds of the serpent. but the doomed african race had to be made “free, or the union has to die.” if we entered the promised land, we must take an emancipated people with us, and so it was agreed that it was better to give liberty to the slave than to go to the grave of the republic.

1871,12,14,1871121401203,New National Era,VA,freedman's savings bank. the transfer to the new building - a magnificent banking palace - an interesting history of the institution - a monument to the memory of him who penned the proclamation of emancipation.,"the business of the fsb is transferred from the well-known location on seventh street to the new building on pennsylvania avenue, opposite the treasury department, which is generally admitted to tbe one of the finest structures for banking purposes in the country, and an addition to the architectural adornments of the city. the building has already been fully described in the chronicle, and it is only now necessary to state that the first floor, which has been reserved for the banking business, has been fitted up with excellent taste ; and while being attractive in appearance, possesses the essential qualities of being substantial and in every respect suitable for the purpose intended. the cashier's room is the first entered, and is a fine one, admirably adapted for the transaction of a large business. a beautiful solid marble counter, paneled and moulded, extends along the entire lenght. this is surmounted by black walnut desks, guarded by railings of the same material, behind which stands the cashier and his assistants. beyond this room is the office of the actuary and his clerks, and within it is the vault for the valuables. this is protected by a massive metal door, which is secured by a ponderous combination lock. within the vault is an immense safe, constructed to resist fire and burglars. these are from the manufactory of the american steam safe company, of baltimore, and have been furnished by their agent, j. c. parker, of seventh street. the inside apartment is for the use of the board of trustees, and is a very fine room. the three rooms have been hand-somely frescoed by shutter, and are neatly and comfortably furnished and carpeted. the entire building has been constructed adn the arrangements completed, by mr. robert fleming, the contractor, who is entitled to much credit for the manner in which the work has been done. a short sketch of the history of this institution, which has grown from a very small beginning until it has attained its present marvelous proportions, may not be uninteresting. early in 1865 a charter of incorporation was obtained from congress, and on the 11th of july in that year rev. j. w. alvord, on the part of the trustees, commissioned mr. william j. wilson, the present cashier, to undertake the work of making the bank known to the colored people of this city and the freedmen of the surrounding localities. mr. wilson was then engaged teaching school, on twelfth street, near r., but notwithstanding there was then no compensation attached to the office, he cheerfully undertook the duty assigned to him. his first office was a rented room in the upper part of a detached brick house on g street, opposite the foundry church. he remained there until the following spring, laboring against much distrust and prejudice in this endeavors to ompress upon his own people the advantages of the project. his first announcement of it was to his own pupils, and one of them, a son of a freedman named hill, told him his father's box had been broken open the previous night and some two hundred dollars carried off. the boy said his father still twenty-four dollars, and asked mr. wilson if he would put that in his bank. the answer being in the affirmative, the father was brought back after school recess and made the first deposit of $24, and so the freedman hill laid the foundation of an institution which struck deep root in the soil, and whose branches now spread over a large portion of the union. a strange oart of the history of that deposit is, that it still remains accumulating, and nothing is known of its owner's fate. the second depositor was the wife of rev. dr. garrett, pastor of the fifteenth street presbyterian colored church ; and the third, mr. walker lewis, now one of the trustees, and the owner of a large, amount of real estate in this city, which he has accumulated by prudent investments. both these made their deposits to show they had confidence in the project and to inspire it in others. during the infancy of the institution mr. wilson carried the funds of it on his person, and he did not find the load a difficult one to transport. he labored on despite of every difficulty, and with the countenance of the eminent men who obtained the charter, determined to make the enterprise a success. in the spring of 1866 a basement room in the house occupied by the freedmen's bureau, at the corner of nineteenth and 1 streets, was assigned as the office of the bank, and there the work was carried on until about the same time in the following year, when it was moved to the northwest corner of pennsylvania avenue and nineteenth street. during this time every effort was used to induce the colored soldiers to deposit something of their pay, and many did so who now reap the benefit of their produce in the ownership of their dwellings. in the winter of 1867 the next move of the bank was to the house of mrs. sullivan, on seventh street, between e and f, where two rooms were rented and occupied for about fourteen months, when another change of base was made to may's building, which has just been vacated. in these years of struggle there was much of interesting incident in the endeavor to establish the bank. a detailed history of this would fill volumes. confidence in savings institutes is a thing of slow growth among all peoples, and it was perculiarly so of the colored race. they were unused to the thing, and those who were foremost in advocating this one were strangers to them, and were in a great measure looked upon with distrust. there were large numbers of colored troops being brought here and quartered in the vicinity. it was considered that they might be induced to save a portion of their pay, and mr. wilson, being one of the representative men of his race, went among them in their camps on pay days and explained the benefits of the institution to them. this was attended with varied results until the first district colored regiment was mustered out, when he succeeded in getting deposits from them amounting to nearly five thousand dollars. he remained in a tent all night with this amount in his breast, but did not sleep much, through anxiety, although having a guard of soldiers to protect him. he carried his treasure safely into town, but for many days some doubting thomases would come along and demand back their money, which, of course, they got ; but some, in their suspicion, called for it at the point of the pistol. a kentucky colored regiment was stationed near this city for about a year, and many of them made regular deposits with the cashier when he paid his regular visits on pay day. a number of these carried away, on leaving, sufficient to purchase homes for themselves. the second district, on its return from texas, and the fourth maryland, which was stationed here for a time, and others, were largely benefited in the same way. in addition to his work among the soldiers, mr. wilson paid several visits to different localities in maryland and virginia, where he met with great success, particularly in richmond and on a farm of general forrest's known as the sandgates, near port tobacco, maryland, where large numbers of laborers were employed. the present extensive, ramifications of the bank by branches throughout the south and southwest, where they have fine buildings and do a large business, are so well known that it is unnecessary to go into particulars, but attention may be again called to the small seed sown by the freedman hill in the shape of his $24 deposit, from which such large fruit has grown, to gather a moral that may be worth pondering on. the depositors now doing business number from 150 to 200, and the daily amount of business transacted varies from six to twenty thousand dollars. the deposits in four weeks have exceeded the drafts by as much as $60,000, and no discounts are made for the public or any officer of the bank. advances are made only on security of real estate.

1871,12,28,1871122801203,New National Era,VA,the freedman's bank and w. j. wilson. ,"we take the following from « anecdotes of public men «, by j. w. forney, published in the sunday chronicle: « after riding along pennsylvania avenue and observing the new residences going up in every quarter, and the broad streets laid with enduring composite, we stopped on the noble walk before the north front of the treasury department and stood opposite the fsb. its history will form a striking chapter in the annals of these times. on the east corner of the same block i pointed out the famous banking house of corcoran & riggs - now managed, i believe, by george w. riggs. the contrast between these two edifices is a contrast between two ideas and suggests a moral better than an argument. let us take two living men - men whose names are immediately associated with these institutions - w. w. corcoran, the head of the little old banking house at the corner, and william j. wilson, cashier of the new savings bank - the one white and the other colored, both natives of the united states, and both sympathizers with the south in the rebellion - corcoran with the confederates and wilson with the slaves. it can be no offence to the white man to say that, like his colored brother, he was of humble origin, and it is equally true that while he flourished under our institutions william j. wilson was oppressed and degraded. the white man grow in riches and in graces with his years. under former administration's, before the sub-treasury, he was the principal depositary of the national funds, and to this day his name is a letter of credit in all financial circles. belonging to the age that is fast passing away, he does not forget that most of his wealth is the result of the confidence of his government ; and in the rapid growth of washington, althouth he himself has resisted many of the recent efforts in that direction, there are no more beautiful objects than his noble art gallery and the louisa home for indigent ladies. the black man had none of these chances. when congress, early in 1865, passed a charter of incorporation for the fsb, w. j. wilson, the present indomitable cashier, was engaged teaching school on twelfth street, near r., in washington city, without remuneration. the trustees called upon him to make the bank known to the colored people of america, and he undertook the work. his first office was a rented room in a small brick house on g street, where he remained for a few months stemming the tide of bigotry against his race, and untiring in teaching them the necessity of hoarding the surplus wages at some institution that would keep them safe and profitably. a freedman in 1866 told wilson that his father's box had been broken into and two hundred stolen, but that the old man had still twenty-four dollars left, and this was the first investment, under wilson's advice, in the fsb. it was the seed from which has grown what is already a gigantic and must become an overwhelming corporation. other deposits followed in rapid succession, real estate was purchased at the corner of nineteenth and 1 streets, in washington. the operations of the concern became too large in a short time, and it was finally moved to the northwest corner of pennsylvania avenue and nineteenth street. during this period colored soldiers began to deposit something of their pay, and those who were wise enough to do so now reap the benefit of their wisdom. in the winter of 1867 the bank was moved, to seventh street, between e and f, where it remained for fourtee months, until finally it was located in the new building opposite the treasury department to which i have referred. there are few banking houses in america equal to it, and yet, large, commodious, and beautiful as it is, it is to be still further extended, inasmuch as the company has purchased the whole of the western portion of the lot, and are even now ambitious to buy out corcoran & riggs, so that the entire square may be given up to them. it may be called a tree of many branches, extending through the south and southwest. they have fine buildings, with capable officiers engaged in the good work of collecting the savings for the freedmen, and so hoarding and investing them that in the course of time the institution. will be second to none on the continent. the washington depositors are from one hundred and fifty to two hundred a day, and the daily amount of business varies from six to twenty thousand dollars. in four weeks these deposits have exceeded the drafts by sixty thousand dollars. no discounts are made for the public or for any of the officers of the bank, and advances are made only on security of real estate. it is unnecessary to give further details. the concern itself stands first among financial institutions. its future may be judged from its present. with ordinary care and integrity it must distance all competitors, inasmuch as it has accured the confidence of the great race which, united for one object, can accomplish almost anything. imagine these millions of colored men, women, and children, all resolved upon hoarding up their earnings in one banking institution, and then contrast this unity of action with the savings banks in other cities and states which have grown rich because they have been preferred by only a portion of the whites, and you have the story in a nutshell. the architect of all this property is william j. wilson, the cashier, an earnest, hard-headed, true-hearted man, with the intelligence, the vigor, and the directness of a john w. garrett or a george law, and the conviction of an oliver cromwell. as a pennsylvanian, i am proud to record the fact that, perhaps, the most efficient and persevering of the coadjutors of mr. wilson in the administration of the affairs of this magnificent institution is colonel d. l. eaton, of pittsburg. but wilson is, in fact, the w. w. corcoran of the colored men of the south, successfully emerging grom a deadlier struggle, fighting against sterner obstacles, and perhaps surer of a grander future. who knows but that in the years that lie beyond, a reputation as pure, a credit as high, may await the posterity of the colored banker as that which has a thousand times awarded the white capitalist? i said at the beginning that christmas is that holiday in which childhood looks joyously forward, and when manhood solemnly looks backward, and, as i conclude this striking contrast, may not both child and man be instructed by its lessons, and alike anticipate the glorious destiny of our country?"

 that promptitude of action and the assistance given by these banks prevented a vast destruction of property is evident, and i would ask you to make the proper appropriation to refund the money as early as practicable. no special appropriation was made at the last session to defray the expenses of the engineer corps, and much inconvenience was the result. it is hoped that this important matter will not be overlooked at this session for upon the activity and efficient of this department depends the protection of the state in levee matters as well as all other internal improvements. 
 the louisiana levee company has lately been recognized, with some of the strongest financial men in the state as directors. mr. gaines, of the citizens’ bank, is its president, while mr. duncan f. kenner, one of the oldest planters on the mississippi river, and a man of great practical experience and knowledge of the levee subject, is its vice president and active business manager. the company has now a cash capital of $500,000, and has assumed the payment of all work contracted for or authorized by me during the late session of uncertainty and delay of the company to prosecnte the work, i have great confidence now that the work will be done promptly."

1872,3,28,1872032801204,New National Era,VA,"origin of the freedman's savings and trust company, and sketch of its founder. ","every visitor to washington inquires about the handsome stone edifice which stands on pennsylvania avenue opposite the north end of the treasury building. its dimensions and appearance indicate a public purpose, and the general inference is that it is a government building. the upper part of it is devoted to government purposes, being occupied by the law department and the signal service bureaus, where they have a degree of comfort not shared by other public functionaries because of the superior height of the ceilings over those of the government buildings, which are all comparatively low. this is the fsb's banking house ; being, in fact, but a wing of the entire structure as it is ultimately intended to be built, and occupying the finest and most conspicuous site in washington. it is quite equal in appearance and completeness of detail to any building in the united states devoted to like purposes, and is a monument to the thrift and energy of the colored race. actively moving about in this building may be seen a white-haired gentleman, whose quickness of movement and nervous energy belong to the period of life's greatest vigor. this is john watson alvord, a. m., the president of the fsb, an institution so young that knowledge of its existence is by no means universal, and many learn of it for the first time when they see its central business house, and hear with surprise that it has handled over thirty millions of dollars in the few years which have passed since the close of the rebellion. practical facts like these seize hold of the mind of our money-loving people, and at once they manifest an interest in the history of that which is so solidly respectable. that history is a short one, and soon told, being, in fact, but an illustration of the quick perception and organizing power of its president. the gentlemen we have spoken of is the father of the fsb, over whose destinies he now presides. its organization is only an incident in his long life of usefulness and strange adventure as you may readily perceive. there is a peculiar admixture of placidity of surface and interior action apparent in his manner and movements. he seems like one whose enthusiasms have been repressed in a school of necessity - who has had to hold a tight rein all his life on the spirit that dwells within him. his eye bright and restless will beam sympathetic light at what you say when his lips make no answer. the blood, too, comes and goes in his face while you address him, showing that his heart responds while his tongue is silent. at once you conclude that president alvord has a history and want to know it. i have looked into it a little and find that he was born in connecticut something less than sixty-five years ago ; that he was educated in the public schools of that state until seventeen years of age, when, with yankee precocity, he went to school-teaching himself. after a few years of this, he became confidendial clerk of a large wholesale business house, and afterward went to savannah, georgia, where his mercantile work was successful ; but on his return home he studled for the ministry, working his way first through the manual labor school, near utica, new york, and helping to support himself by teaching in vacation a select school in that city ; engaged, also, meanwhile as agent of the american sunday school union in lecturing through herkimer and other counties, establishing sabbath schools and libraries. the year 1833 found him pursuing his studies at lane seminary, ohio, under the presidency of rev. lyman beecher, d. d., where, in the fall of 1834, he took part in the rebellion of students who had been prohibited the discussion of the slavery question. with fifty others he left the seminary, and with twenty of whom formed an association for study under the patronage of dr. gamaliel bailey, arthur tappan, and others ; and while thus engaged took the superintendence of colored schools in cincinnati, six in number, although prejudice was so strong as to exclude him from all white society. after a year or two of such service, having made a perilous lecturing tour beset by mobs, through northern ohio for the anti-slavery society, mr. alvord united with his old classmates at oberlin, and graduated in the first class from that institution. he never lost the opportunity of assisting fugitive slaves, and was subjected to all the indignities which devoted service to a down-trodden race brought upon its friends in those early days of abolition. this kind of treatment, strenghtened his devotion to the african race, and, despairing of immediate emancipation, he determined to go to africa as a missionary. to prepare himself for this field of labor, he went to new york and entered upon the study of medicine ; but before the close of his term was attacked with an illness which nearly proved fatal, and laid him up in ordinary for several years, part of the time being spent at st. augustine, florida. this was during the semi-nole war, and mr. a. availed himself of his opportunity to become conversant with the instituion of slavery practically, and observe its effects upon both master and servant, as well as upon this devoted indian tribe. from 1841 to 1845 he was associated pastor of a congregational church at stamford, connecticut, and in 1846 took charge of the phillip's church in boston, massachusetts, where with success he remained till 1851 ; when, his health again failing, he left for europe, and traveled extensively in russia, a country at that time but little known to americans. here, at kamini ostroff, a beautiful suburb of st. petersburg, mr. alvord was the guest of the grand duke of oldenburg, and enjoyed many opportunities of studying the society and institutions of the russian empire. during his absence he also traveled in germany, france, england, and scotland, and with apparently restored health returned to his old pastorate and resumed his duties. a few months' service, however, revealed to him the necessity of discontinuing that kind of labor ; and, very much to the regret of his congregation, sought release from his charge, which he obtained in 1852. he then, after protracted discussion on the question of antislavery publications, became secretary of the american tract society, boston, for several years, and when the rebellion broke out, came to washington to superintend the circulation of books and papers among the union soldiers. this work grew upon his hands, and he followed the army into the field in the spring of 1862, leaving assistants in washington to forward to him reading matter and hospital stores. of the latter alone he distributed more than forty tons, gratuitously furnished for sick and wounded soldiers. his frequent letters from amidst those thrilling events were widely circulated. battle-fields and hospitals became for five years the familiar scenes of his labors, which were anterior to, and the precursors of the sanitary and christian commissions, with both of which he cooperated to the end of the war. on the entrance of general sherman to savannah, he went there and commenced the first educational efforts for freedmen in georgia ; five hundred of whom were at once gathered as pupils, and marched through the streets to buildings (bryan's slave mart and oglethorpe university) assigned them by post commander geary. he was afterward « inspector of schools and finances » under general howard, and then during four-and-a-half-years « general superintendent of schools for freedmen » throughout all the states lately in rebellion. his ten semi-annual reports giving the statistics and results of this work were printed by the freedmen's bureau. in the autumn of 1864 mr. alvord proposed to gentlemen in new york the institution of a national savings bank for freedmen, and in the winter of 1864-65', by their aid and the earnest assistance of senators sumner and wilson, and mr. eliot of the house, he secured the passage of an act of congress chartering the fsb, which was signed by abraham lincoln on the 3d of april, 1865, being one of his last autographs. on the 4th of april, 1865, the corporators met and elected william a. booth president and j. w. alvord corresponding secretary, directing the latter to organize branches throughout the southern states, which he proceeded forthwith to do. the first place of business selected for the principal office was no. 87 cedar street, new york ; and the first branch established was at norfolk, virginia, on the 3d day of june, 1865. on the 11th of july, 1865, the first deposit was made at washington, d. c., and on the first day of august following a branch was opened here. the branch at louisville was organized on the 1st of september, 1865, that at richmond october 13th. the military bank at beaufort, south carolina, became a branch of this institution october 16th ; fifteen branches in all having been opened by the end of the fiscal year, march, 1866. in 1867 the meetings of the board of trustees were transferred from new york to washington, and this was made the principal office of the company, occupying first the northwest corner of pennsylvania avenue and nineteenth street, afterward the building on seventh street, opposite the general post office, until december 7, 1871, when the company removed, with its washington branch, to the spacious building located on president square. mr. booth was succeeded in the presidency by mahlon t. hewitt, esq., who served till 1868, with mr. alvord as first vice president. on the 12th of march, 1868, mr. alvord was elected president, and has held that position ever since. for the past three years he has devoted himself exclusively to the interests of the institution which was founded by him and over which he presides. it is a signal success, and one of which he, with his condjuctors and assistants, may well be proud. it has thirty-three branches, and its total deposits have amounted to the handsome aggregate of over $31,000,000, ($12,000,000 of this during the last year) while the balance on hand due depositors is about $3,700,000. mr. alvord's degree of a. m. was confered upon him by yale college, and has been honored by the hard labors of a well-spent life. he exhibits the same determined purpose, untiring energy, and business shrewdness in the management of a financial institution which have characterized him in other pursuits, and is a practical illustration of the readiness with which americans adapt themselves to the requirements of a varied life. at the annual election held on thursday last the trustees of the fsb showed their continued appreciation of the services of mr. alvord by re-electing him president for the ensuing year.

1872,5,9,1872050901204,New National Era,VA,senator wilson's great work.,"we are gratified to learn that the first volume of the work of senator henry wilson, on the « rise and fall of the slave power in america », is having a sale far beyond expectations for a work so large. the first volume brings the record only up to 1845, covering but nine years of the long and eventful period of thirty-six years, during which mr. wilson has steadily been fighting the good fight. the story of toll, peril, and self-sacrifice by the early abolitionists reads like a romance of the simplest pathos. the story of the succeeding years, during which mr. wilson has been so close an observer and so active a participant, cannot fall to be even more interesting. his singular fitness for the great work he has undertaken is made the more manifest when we remember his tireless work in congress for freedom, and particularly when the vigor and sagacity of his championship is viewed in the light of the remarkable series of measures introduced by him relating to emancipation and civil rights - all of which became laws of the land. mr. wilson introduced the bill abolishing slavery in the district of columbia, by which more than three thousand slaves were made free and slavery forever prohibited. he introduced a provision which became law on the 21st of may, 1862, providing that persons of color in the district of columbia should be subject to the same laws to which white persons were subject - that they should be tried for offenses against the laws in the same manner in which white persons are tried, and, if convicted, to be liable to the same penalty and no other to which white persons would be liable for the same offense. this act nulified the brutalizing, degrading, and inhuman black code of the district. on the 12th of july, 1862, he introduced the bill which became the law on the 17th, to amend the act of 1794 to call out the millitia to execute the laws. this act made colored men a part of the military forces, authorized the president to receive into the military and naval service persons of african descent, and made free such persons, their mothers, wives, and children, if they were the slaves of persons giving aid to the rebellion. when the amendment to the enrolment act was pending in the house, it was so amended as to make colored men, whether free or slave, a part of the national forces, and their masters were to receive a bounty when they should give freedom to slaves who might be drafted into the ser. in th committee of confeence mr. wilson moved that the slaves drafted into the service should be made free by authority of the government the moment they entered it. his motion was agreed to ; it became the law of the land, and general palmer reported that in kentucky alone more than twenty thousand slaves were made free by it. mr. wilson introduced a bill, which became the law, making the wives and children of colored soldiers free, and general palmer, then commanding the united states forces in kentucky, in an official report, made six months after the passage of that act, estimated that seventy-five thousands women and children were made free by it. thens of thousands of the wives and children of such soldiers in the states of delaware, maryland, west virginia, kentucky, tennessee, and missouri were thus made free under mr. wilson son's four measures. the act abolishing slavery in the district of columbia ; the act making colored persons received into the military service, their mothers, wives, and children, if owned by rebels, free ; the making all slaves free when mustered into the military service ; and the act making their wives and children free, emancipated not less than a quarter of a million of slaves in the border states. mr. wilson introduced into the appropriation bill of 1864 a section providing that all persons of color who had been, or who might be, mustered into the military service, should receive the same uniform, clothing, arms, equipments, rations, medical attendance, and pay as white soldiers. he reported from the committee of conference, to which has been referred the bill in relation to the freedman's bureau, and entirely new bill, to establish in the war department a bureau for the relief of freedmen and refugees, which became a law, under which that beneficent instrumentality the freedman's bureau was organized. on mr. wilson's motion the provision was adopted that the lands sold for taxes in south carolina should be divided into lots of forty acres each and sold at low rates ; under which act many freedmen obtained homesteads. mr. wilson introduced the bill that abolished peonage in new mexico, the provision striking the word « white » from the militia laws, and also the measure that prohibited the punishment by whipping in the unreconstructed states. mr. wilson introduced in 1863 a bill, which became a law, incorporating « an institution for the education of colored youth in the district of columbia » ; the act « incorporating the howard university » ; and also the act « to incorporate the national fsb ». mr. wilson also introduced many other measures in relation to slavery and the rights of persons of color, either as independent measures or as amendments to measures introduced by others.

1872,5,9,1872050901203,New National Era,VA,the national freedman's savings and trust company,"in a former letter we took occasion to refer to the increasing success with which this company is meeting, and the beneficial influence which it is having over the working classes, wherever its branches have been opened. long since it was predicted that the bank would prove a failure. that it was simply a trap set to catch the credulous and unsuspecting. but the highly satisfactory manner in which it continues to deal with its patrons has had the effect of contradicting all such mischievous reports, and placing the bank before the people in the attitude of what it really is - a benevolent enterprise. the fears which many entertained of its safety are dispersing, and the idea of a « negro bank », as some call it, is no longer a novelty, but an unquestioned reality. none can doubt the magnitude of the work which has been accomplished through this agency ; it is everywhere visible ; lands, houses, cattle, the general prosperity among its depositors ; all tell us what has been done. and yet the bank is just entering upon its career of usefulness compared with what remains to be done. its branches are scattered throughout the south, and each can be made a centre of light and information from whence the ignorant and unlearned may avail themselves of the counsel of good and judicious men. this is greatly needed, and produces happy results, when rightly administrated. if the finances of the bank continue to be prudently managed, we see no reason why it should not become one of the most powerful corporations in the country. the branch in this city, after four years' struggling against opposition, misrepresentations, and false reports industriously circulated by its enemies to impair its usefulness, is approaching a condition in every way gratifying. it is daily growing in popular favor and confidence. we take no little pleasure in according to many of our staunchest conservative citizens the credit of having assisted greatly in building up this branch. indeed to tell the whole they have shown more concern, and have entered more actively and heartily into the work of bringing in deposits than our republican friends, with a few honorable exceptions. one gentleman, we are informed, went so far as to raise the pay of his employés on condition that they would deposit some of their earnings each month. in this way he induced quite a number, both white and colored, to deposit in our bank. we append a statement of the business of this branch for the weel ending april 20. 1872: total deposits for the week: $11,894.55. total drafts for the week: $1,903.72. gain for the week: $9,990.83.

1872,10,24,1872102401203,New National Era,VA,the freedman's bank.,"this institution, established as a teacher of the freedmen in the value and importance of saving their hard earnings, has been so eminently successful in its aim and purpose as not only to be an instructor of the freedmen, but by its careful business management has attracted the patronage of a large and increasing number of white depositors in the district of columbia. this has excited the managers of some of our white banking institutions to such an extent as to rouse their jealousy to the pitch of slandering the fsb and attempting to create distrust among its many patrons. the fsb, notwithstanding the slanders of envious bankers, is fully competent to meet promptly any legitimate demand that can be made upon it. the slight « run » of last week had no foundation in reason, as was well shown by the promptness with which every demand was met at the counters of the fsb. the depositors and patrons of the fsb should remember that indulging in a « run » upon that institution is simply attempting to break themselves, as the bank is conducted solely in the interest of the depositors. this bank has been quite a help to colored men and women, as well as to some of the churches in this community in the matter of loans through which churches have been erected and private property improved and increased in value. should a « run » on the fsb necessitate the calling in of money loaned to our colored churches and individuals on short notice, it needs no prophet to foretell the large amount of suffering sure to follow. a « run » on the fsb will not be successful in damaging that institution, as it is abundantly able to meet all demands ; it might, however, have the effect of reducing the dividend or interest to depositors by forcing the bank to keep extraordinary large balances on hand, to meet the demands of patrons blinded to their own interests by the slanders of jealous bankers, whose institutions lack that standing in the community for which the fsb is so deservedly conspicuous. colored depositors especially should be alive to the great opportunity afforded by the fsb, for not only taking care of their money, but of paying larger dividends than any other institution of the kind in the city. among the officers of this institution are colored men of ability, who have the highest interest of their race at heart ; among its employes are young colored men who are acquiring a knowledge of business and enterprise not afforded to colored people by any other banking institution in the nation. those bankers in our midst, who are striving by base insinuation to create a feeling of distrust among the colored depositors, would slam their doors in the face of any colored young man, who would dare to ask employment at their hands. the fsb is able to pay every cent due depositors on demand, yet it is not a sensible thing to make the demand. such action, if made general by depositors so as to include all the banks in the city, would very soon be the death of all our banking institutions and a general breaking up of all business in the district of columbia, causing great suffering, and all for the lacking of the exercise of a little common sense among depositors. colored men, women, and children, remember that your life-long enemies in this community are striving to break down the fsb. you have by your good sense shown that you can save money, and erect the finest bank building in the south, continue to show good sense by not allowing the ex-dealers in your bone and sinew to frighten you from the support of an institution that is a powerful instrument in the work of your advancement. by your steady support, and continued confidence of the fsb you crush one of the fondest hopes of old fogy bankers of putting new life into their fast decaying institutions whose chief support came from your unpaid toil."

1873,3,6,1873030601203,New National Era,VA,the freedman's savings bank.,"this institution has already done a noble work. the uneducated among our people have, to some extent, learned through it the nature of credit and the value of forethought in securing credit. every deposit made in the bank has a tendency to cement the depositor's interest more firmly to the locality where it is made, or else it develops in greater strenght his sense of independence of those who would tie him to a locality against his will. realising the importance of his copartnership with his race, in the plan of saving, by which it may one day become the owner of much of the southern soil, and understanding the power which accumulated means will give him in the way of preferment and usefulness, he rises above the habits, customs, and feelings which characterize the majority of his brethren, and becomes an inspiring example to them. the educational influences thus derived have a strikingly progressive effect upon our whole people. but this is not the highest of the achievements of the fsb. it has very largely utilized the native talent, the educational ability and integrity among colored men. when the young man of character and qualifications has felt the first cold dash of repellant influences as he applied to the bank or counting-house kept by the richer race, our bank has flung its doors open to him and offered him the means of a business, education as a revives of his hopes and aspirations. the need fof such education cannot, at this time, be overestimated. we need it everywhere and always. the foretought of the endured cotton picker on the red river, who buys or begs a newspaper from the passing steamer, and gets someone to read to him, the commercial statement of the weel, that he may learn what the price of cotton is, it may be on the lower end of the ladder, but still he is climbing. the colored politician, who, while he wields thousands of votes, yet has nothing to do with the business of making up the nomination state, is a little higher than the cotton picker, but still he is too low down to do good business. it is a fact that the colored man who turns his attention to commerce, seeks in vain to penetrate even the ordinary secrets of the chamber of commerce ; and why? simply because a lack of business tact or of business experience, prevents him from controlling other people's business interests with [?]. whenever colored men have the experience or the tact, as in the case of stephen [?] william metz, wherever they have the political tact and courage necessary, as in the case of gov. pinchback and gov. donn - in other case they atone for an unpopular color, by popular methods. to us it [?] that the fsb is helping largely towards giving a sufficient number of our people commercial knowledge that may be available in instructing those who have had none heretofore. the bank is abling in the development of business power, as well as in the promotion of business knowledge. [?] we understand, and we hope our information is correct, to [?] southern depositors by small loans on undoubted security. perhaps, up to this time, safety required some stubbornness in regard to such accomodations but at present we see no reason why ample collateral should not command assistance for those whose money so largely make up the sum total of deposits in the bank, for we regard the bank as one of our greatest educators.

1873,3,13,1873031301203,New National Era,VA,the freedman's savings bank.,"a correspondent of the boston advertiser recently forwarded a statement from washington to that paper professing to be a synopsis of the report of the comptroller of the currency on the condition of the fsb. in this pretended synopsis were huddled together whatever tended to cause distrust in the institution and that which made in its favor was studiously emitted. the fact is that the examiner who had charge of the investigation of the affairs of this institution speaks as follows of it: « the executive officers are, many opinion, men of the most undoubted integrity of character, devoted to the best interests of the institution, working for small compensations, and have educated themselves to the practical knowledge of the business of a savings bank to a degree that promises a prosperous future for the institution ». we do not undertake to say that the bank in its management cannot be improved. we certainly hold the contrary opinion. we believe that it should, as far as it has the power, encourage every industry engaged in by colored men, as ninety per cent. if there is any officer who is tainted with colorphobia to such an extent as not to be able to appreciate the importance of the bank's assisting colored enterprises when it can do so without loss to itself, but much good to the enterprise, such officer should be removed and another should take his place who can understand that the institution was originated for the specific purpose of adding in the work of building up a race whose history has been that of an outraged and oppressed people. the colored people of the south have been taught, through the instrumentality of this bank, the importance of saving their hard earnings, and we cannot permit a word against the solvency of the institution to go without correction, when the facts are that it is really safe concern. we have no difficulty in finding the reason for this attempt of the correspondent of the boston advertiser to create a distrust in the fsb. it is no doubt inspired by the banking interests of the south that has become jealous of the growth of the fsb. it is the work of the enemies of the race, and comes from no feeling of sollicitude for the welfare of the major portion of the depositors of this institution. we say to our people stand by the bank, and at the same time persist that it do its full duty in standing by the race. "
1873,3,20,1873032001203,New National Era,VA,branches of the freedman's bank,"we regret the recent agitation on this subject, especially the hasty judgment expressed by some of our contemporaries. our paper issues from the immediate neighborhood of the bank, and we ought to know the facts. there is, indeed, no direct legislation in their charter granting power to have branches, but the necessity of the work requires this, and we happen to know that such was the expectation of members of congress most active in obtaining the charter. we notice nothing in this organic law against branches: hence their existence can be no [?] of charter. the trustees were left to follow their best judgment in executing the trust committed to them, via « to receive on deposit such sums of [?] from time to time be offered therefore, on behalf of persons heretofore held in slavery in the united states, or their decendents. [?] course some agency had to be established at localties where this class of persons resided. the controller's late report avidently intends only to state the absence of legislation on this subject, and also does not design to weaken the high credit of the institution. let him speak for himself. in a dispatch, through the associated press, dated march 10, 1873, he says: « the reports of the controller of the currency and of the national bank examiner upon the condition of the fsb of this city, was intented to furnish congress information with reference to technical violations of the law under which the institution was organized. the security upon which the loans were made in considered by the controller and the examiner, with few exceptions, as good as the amout [?]. there is nothing in the reports which conveys the impression that the bank cannot respond to the demands of the depositors. the examiner states that the executive [?] are, in his opinion, men of the most undoubted integrity of character, devoted to the best interests of the institution, who have elevated themselves to a practical knowledge of the business of the institution, which promises a prosperous future for it. the controller of the currency states that the bank will be able to correct mistakes, and continue a business of great usefulness to the class of depositors for whose benefit the institution was organized. this officer permits us to correct the printer's error, (not ours) which makes him assert in his report that [?] it should read  [?]. we are assured by the hon. chairman of the senate committee, that « congress has no idea of interfering with the business of the branches of the company: have no right to do so if they would ». the report of the controller, he says, only furnishes information on the subject for future legislation, and adds, « my impression is the bank has done a great and good work. let it go on and do, in the main, [?] has done ». if anything farther was needed beyond the very favorable report of inspector melgs, (which we publish elsewhere). it would be the testimony of the present hon. secretary of the treasury, who says in resigning his membership in the board trustees, february 3, 1873: « sympathizing deeply with the object of your institution to encourage thrift and economy among the freedmen i wish you the full measure of success to which you are justly entitled. but finally, there can certainly be no special danger to depositors at branches, in any case. their deposit books are the legal vouchers of the corporation and all of them payable, if need be, at headquarters. if this bank, as the inspector declares, has a full surplus of some thousands of dollars over all liabilities (and this surplus has been considerably increased since his examination) then we may be sure that « officers of undoubted integrity » will be able to manage the work hereafter with the same safety and prosperity as in times past. we bespeak the continued confidence of all classes in this excellent institution.

(the bulletin is issued as a daily [?] journal devoted exclusively to commercial and financial affairs). by act of congress, passed january 20, 1873, the controller of the currency was authorized to make an examination of banks organized in the district of columbia under acts of congress, and to report to congress the results of such examination. immediately upon the passage of this act, charles a. meigs, esq., national bank examiner of new york city, was directed to make an examination of all associations not organized under the provisions of the national currency act, and he has just submitted complete and detailed reports of the washington city savings bank, gsb, and the fsb. « the report of the fsb will especially interest the readers of the bulletin, as the new york branch, located at 185 bleecker street, is one of our institutions for savings which exerts a wholesome influence not alone among the freedmen and their families who patronize the bank, but also among a large number of white citizens living in that and other parts of the city. the statement of the fsb was rendered january 18, 1873, and the total amount of assets at that date was $4,483,732.58, and the deposits amounted to $4,008,642.34. the bills payable were $460,000. the bank holds $718,630 of united states bonds, a portion of which have been pledged as collateral security for its bills payable. the bank also holds washington city securities and claims against the board of public works amounting to $54,175.63. its loans upon real estate, chiefly in the city of washington, amount to $1,794,478.63. loans have also been made upon vouchers of the board of public works amounting to $189,000 upon chattel mortgage, $37,000 ; and upon other collateral and personal security to the amount of $250,653.40. as the bank has loaned nearly two millions on real estate, the examiner was careful to make particular examination of the security of the loans upon real estate, and found the bonds and mortgages all placed with due regard to undoubted safety. in regard to the management of the bank, mr. meigs says: « the executive officers are, in my opinion, men of the most undoubted integrity of character, devoted to the best interests of the institution, working for small compensations, and have educated themselves to the practical knowledge of the business of a savings bank to a degree that promises a prosperous future for the institution ». the examiner respectfully suggests the enactment of a general savings bank act, which shall define very clearly the character of the property on which such banks shall advance money, and closes his report by recommending « such frequent and full reports to congress or the controller of the currency of their actual condition - examination, annually at least, by experts - as shall tend to check all departures from a sound, legitimate business career, and such wise liberality and encouragement to this « fsb » as shall tend to perpetuate an institution which has already done so much to elevate and educate the freedmen ». the executive officers are the following well-known gentlemen: j. w. alvord, president ; washington, d. c. ; sam. l., harris, manager ; and john j. zuille, cashier, new york branch.

1873,5,1,1873050101203,New National Era,VA,savings bank collapsed.,"the bowling green savings bank failed on the 18th of november, 1871, having among the nominal assets $25,000 of invisible bonds of this city, $38,441 of loans on utterly valueless collaterals, and $69,023 of call loans in the names of persons who have never been found. one dividend of 25 per cent, has already been made, and another of 10 per cent., which will be the last, is now ready. it is impossible by any language to do justice to the cruelty of this robbery of the ignorant poor ; to the resisting influence it used upon thrifty habits, and the temptation it offered to the uses of those who thrive on the vices of the great mass of workmen for wages ; and to the villainy which committed this foulest of wrongs and has thus far-refused to make any restitution. the men who rob savings should be blasted out of human likeness, and should go grogeling on all fours thenceforward. that these persons who dishonor the name of thief have gone unpunished, and are almost certain to escape indefinitely, is a fact about which it seems useless to say a word of comment. - new york financier. the paragraph above given tells a sad story. its language, though severe in its application to those who managed and robbed the bank, is equally just. nothing can compensate, upon the failure of such a bank, for the consternation, anxiety, discouragement, distrust, and suffering spread among the poor people. so sensitive are the people as to the perfect safety of their stored and precious earnings that upon the slightest rumor to the contrary, in utter forgetfulness of all ailments they begin the « run » as for dear life. among the motley and clamorous group about the banking-house doors are to be found the laborer who has just the bed of a twenty-foot sewer, in which, by hard labor, he earned his small bank balance, and knows well the value of it ; the domestic or servant, whose scanty earnings, the result of many month's tell and economizing, are in jeopardy ; the bootblack and newsboy, who, with great reluctance, have been induced to deny themselves the immediate use of a single half-dime, from week to week, in anticipation of the bright future prospects to be realized by the accumulated dollar. the importance of these savings institutions in their effects upon the poor generally, and especially upon the habits and aspirations of the colored people of the country ; the large and invaluable work done by the fsbs during the last eight years in the southern communities ; the apparent restlessness now exhibited by our people for the establishment of private or individual savings banks ; destined, we fear, to shate the fate of the bowling green bank, lead us to present some reflections to the colored people which may not be without interest at present, and to which time at least with its better experience will accord value. the most important question involved in the establishment of a savings bank, is perfect safety in the keeping or investment of its funds. poor people need a place where they can put away spare pennies, (considered of little consequence in themselves and usually squandered if kept in the pocket), with the conviction that the resulting dollars can always be found when called for. these pennies are not gathered and stored for the benefit of avaricious and thieving men who live by the toll of others. we know of no obligation on the part of the poor men to save their small earnings for the accommodation (at the risk of their own interests) of the individuals in any particular community. such money received from the struggling masses is to be handled, first, with entire reference to its safety ; and, secondly, except so much as is needed for daily use, is to be invested wherever it will realize the largest profit, with the least risk, whether in europe or america, east or west, north or south. capital always seeks what is considered greatest accurity. this doctrine we believe to be in accordance with good sense and sound business principles. just here is to be considered the apparent dissatisfaction said to be manifested by many of the depositors at the branch agencies of the fsb, who are being stirred up because their money is not invested in the immediate locality of the bank. we do not assert from positive knowledge that this feeling is engendered by greedy men who are anxious to gobble up the $4,000,000 saved by the colored people ; nor at this distance can we prove that it is the result of jealousy on the part of other private banking enterprises in the south, that are eager to manipulate the money of colored people. but we do maintain that all the spare capital of the anglo saxon in the south, seeking security of investment, finds its way north. further, we challenge contradiction of the statement, that were the vast lands of the south distributed and peopled, under cultivation and valubale ; were the bonds of the southern states sure of redemption and not reputation ; were the southern railroads and other enterprises stable and paying investments, then would millions upon millions of dollars at once flow into the south from the north and from europe. if the thousands of depositors in the fsbs desire that their money be invested in the south, in preference to other localities where greater safety and surer profits are to be obtained, it is to be presumed that they can be accommodated. for two hundred years they have tolled for the upbuilding of the south without compensation. this desire to contribute $4,000,000 more to that impoverished locality, with all the accompanying risks, is in keeping with the lifelong generosity of the race. we urge the colored people to consider well any efforts making to establish private banks, simply because the trustees of the fsb do not regard southern securities as safe banks springing up from such a cause will, sooner or later, share the fate of the bowling green bank. every new bank established by colored men, managed by officers grounded in principles of integrity, for the real advancement of our people, will be bailed with pleasure in financial circles, and with great pride by those interested in the development of the race. in the meantime no language can too strongly convey our belief in the usefulness, the solidity, and the growing power of the fsbs in this country. controlled by disinterested trustees, colored and white, (many of them gentlemen of rare financial ability) who are studying the experience of the past and daily becoming more zealous and watchful of the interests ontrusted to them ; manned by officers who are hourly evolving plans for greater safeguards, checks, and balances in the transaction of business, with agencies and representatives at the great monted center, new york, as well as philadelphia, washington, and all the leading cities in the south. these banks afford opportunities, convenlences, and safety for the profitable investment of small earnings, not surpassed by any banking-house in the land. their deposits will soon reach ten millions.

1873,5,18,1873051803205,Atlanta Daily Herald,GA,freedman's savings bank,"dollars and dimes. drafts and deposits — fsb — business of the atlanta branch. fsb. desirous of obtaining reliable information, in regard to the financial status of the freedmen of atlanta, for the purpose of communicating the same to the public, for the reason that light upon this subject has been eagerly sought for, we wended our way to the branch office of the freedman's sayings ends trust company, in this city, and made known the object of
our mission to mr. phillip d. cory, the efficient and courteous cashier, who received us with expressions of friendship for the journal we represent, and though busily engaged in the discharge of his duties consented to give us whatever facts and data we desired. it is roper here to state that the atlanta branch of the company was not established until january 15th, 1870, at which time it was opened for business, first on bread street, then on alabama street, in one of the buildings now occupied by the herald, and still later at its present location, corner of broad and walton streets. the company was organized since the late war, with its principal office in the city of washington, and now has thirty-four branch offices in the southern states, four of which are in georgia—one in augusta, macon, savannah and atlanta. we were very agreeably surprised at the exhibit made to us in reference to the matter of deposits by the colored people of atlanta since the opening of the office here, and it goes to show that an effort has been made to save their earnings. the total amount of deposits up to the present time has been $357,621.27, while the amount of drafts for the same time bas only been $319,883.43, reaving a balance of $37,737.78 now due depositors. the total number of deposits has been 14,750, and the total number of drafts $10,096. there are now about 1,100 depositors, averaging nearly $34 to each account many of these are children’s accounts, of only a few cents in amount, the bank receiving deposits of five cents and upwards. the largest deposit by any one colored man is $1,500. the company allows interest at the rate of six per cent. on all sums of $5 and upwards from the first day of the month, after which the amount is deposited payable semi-annually. among the prominent depositors here, we note revs. j. a. wood and prank quarles, c. l. bridwell, crawford munroe, william finch, mitchell cargill and james tate. there has been over $100,000 expended in real estate investments by depositors of the bank since january 1870, which show a tendency on the part of the freedman to abandon his migratory practice and settle down permanently—this strengthens his local attachments. the company loans money at ten per cent, per annum, and the only investments made are in government bonds and real estate securities, the policy being prudential and intended to guard against a crisis or a crash.

the office. 
the office here presents a very neat appearance and has all the appointments necessary for an institution of its kind. mr. cory, the cashier, is a white man, while the assistants in this department are two intelligent, bright mulatoes. these seem to understand their business, have a clear conception of their duties and the system at command. the counter often presents a curious and interesting spectacle, a striking contrast worthy the attention of mr. hyde, the artist. here may be seen the schoolboy and girl depositing nickels and dimes; the women with children in their arms storing away the proceeds derived from their labor, in washing, ironing, etc.; the old and sturdy son of africa, with hammer or a day’s rations in his hand, on saturday evening, laying aside the remainder of his week’s earnings to grow and increase by interest: the gay and festive barber, with mustache and hair trimmed with all the skill of the french artist preparing for the time when customers depart to return no more, when men's beards ceased to grow, and when nature resumes her sway. reader,
will either of these things ever occur?"

1873,7,24,1873072401206,New National Era,VA,letters from virginia,"richmond, july 15, 1873. to the editors of the new national era and citizen: dear sirs: the present prosperous condition of things in the old dominion prompt me to write this communication to your valuable paper. the public schools have just closed, and when i sat in assembly hall, listening to the exercises carried on by colored children in the city of richmond, i was really proud. from these exercises i could see that the bitter hatred and prejudice which characterized virginians during the war is gradually dying out, and that the people of this state, as in a great many others, are beginning to believe that something can be made of the negro. the colored normal school of this city has just graduated several young ladies and gentlemen ; these have their diplomas recommending them as teachers in the public schools of richmond and the state of virginia. i am glad to see that the colored people of this city are becoming large property-holders. this is contradicting in toto the statement made concerning them immediately after the war, « that the negro would never accumulate money or purchase property ». the people are now endeavoring to purchase land for the erection of an infirmary for old and crippled colored people. i think the object is a worthy one ; and from the interest now manifested in the enterprise i think it will be a success. i am sorry to write that there is a kind of opposition to the fsb in this city among the colored people, and so great is this opposition getting that measures have already been adopted to organize a « colored banking company » here. this opposition, i understand, arises principally from two things. first. the people claim that whenever they desire to draw money they can't do it unless the depositor goes himself and gets it: in other words, no one but the depositor can or will be allowed to draw out money. the second objection is, that no one can borrow any amount from the bank, it makes no difference how much property one has. these two objections have been working so much upon the minds of prominent colored real estate owners here that they have already commenced to deposit their moneys in the banking institution carried on by, and principally for the use of, the white population. of course i know the fsb is open to all who desire to deposit ; but the colored people are its principal supporters down here, and if they withhold their sums, the bank must inevitably suffer great loss. political affairs are looming up brighter and brighter every day. i am sorry to say that there is one faction led on by one fleming jackson and congressman-elect j. ambler smith.

1873,7,31,1873073101203,New National Era,VA,freedman's bank.,"our richmond correspondent informed us last week that there is some opposition to the fsb in that city, resulting from two causes ; first, because no one can draw money deposited except the depositor himself ; secondly, because real estate owners or others wanting money cannot borrow it from this bank. it seems to us that upon the very face of the first objection, the reply is suggested. it would be a very dangerous policy for this bank to pay out money to any and all persons who might appear at its counters with the bank books of its depositors, representing themselves as sent to draw money. the provision in regard to drawing money is simply made for the safety and protection of the depositor, and not for the convenience of the bank. we presume that if any depositor should order in writing that his deposits be paid to any persons presenting his bank book, there would be no difficulty in obtaining money at any time and through any messenger. further, if the colored depositors in the richmond branch prefer it, we presume that they can arrange with the cashier to open an account enabling them to draw at any time by checks without even presenting the bank book. we sincerely hope the depositors of the fsb sympathize with, and fully sustain the officials of that bank in any regulation calculated to prevent bad men from stealing the money of depositors, or obtaining the same on false representations. these banks are organized for the purpose of safely keeping the small earnings of poor people, and of returning the same at any time to the rightful owner. the officers and trustees are anxious to do anything which will contribute to safety in keeping or convenience in returning the money. in reply to the second objection, it is apparent from what has already been said, that the money of the colored people is not gathered up and deposited to accommodate real estate owners. we suspect that if the banking officers were to loan $50,000 of the money of the depositors on real estate, and the title to the land should by the manipulations of interested lawyers be recommended, when in fact defective ; if thereafter a law suit should compel the bank to spend more than the amont made in interest on the loan, and perhaps result in the loss of the entire loan, it would not be a sufficient answer to say to depositors on calling for their money that it had been put in the bank for the convenience of men desiring to borrow, (real estate owners) and had been lost. it must be understood that this business of loaning money to avaricious men is a very dangerous one. they will, in many instances, make any sort of representations to obtain money, but when it becomes due and payment is asked, it is a most difficult thing to recover the money. it must be understood further that in making investments or loans of money, it is the experience of the trustees at washington that the vigilance of a finance committee of the strongest men in the board, the knowledge and watchfulness of president and actuary, as well as the aid of the solicitor of the bank, are all required to prevent losses. now when it is remembered that we have only a cashier at the branches (fully engaged in other duties) further that the bank would seldom realize ten per cent over and above all expenses ; indeed that the four per cent, beyond what is required in paying interest on deposits, would be expended in correspondence or lawyers fees in collecting the loan, the reason for not making loans to anxious real estate agents in the south are very apparent. the bank has of late made some loans in the south and will doubtless make others, but they are cases which there are no risks. if the colored citizens of richmond are considering the propriety of organizing another bank in the city, we hope they will not be induced to do so simply from opposition to the fsb. success in banking organizations is not secured simply from opposition to other banks. we advise them to consider well the wants of the city in banking facilities, as well as the expense to be incurred in running such a bank. to succeed in such an enterprise, it is necessary to have a president, cashier, clerk, and numerous other machinery all costing vast sums of money. experience will wreck any enterprise in which these things are not maturely considered.

1873,8,14,1873081401203,New National Era,VA,a freedmen's land company. to be a national organization.,"marshall, texas, july 24, 1873. to the editors of the new national era and citizen: by your kind permit, i submit through the columns of your excellent paper, to the true friends of the colored race, a proposition for the organization of a freedmen's land company. such an organization is needed as a supplement to the fsb. by the aid of the fsb, our people, in the large cities and great money centres of the south, have made very encouraging progress in the acquisition of property, both personal and real. their great want is homesteads of their own, and as the operations of the bank are confined principally to large cities, we need a national land company, to aid and encourage the landless poor, throughout the entire south, in acquiring homesteads. in my opinion the best, if not the only plan for the permanent elevation of the masses of the freedmen, is to assist and encourage them in settling, in colonies, on lands of their own. so long as they remain landless they will be poor, oppressed, and outraged. a community of renters can build no neat and comfortable houses for their families, plant no trees, make no permanent improvements of any kind, because they do not know one year where they will be the next year, for that must depend, mainly, upon the will of their landlord. much might be done by local companies, but it seems to me that a national company, with agencies in most of the southern and western states, would be much preferable. the company should be under the control of a board of managers composed of tried and true men, such as those who compose the board of managers of the fsb and under the supervision of congress. there are, doubtless, many persons among the friends of the freedmen who might be induced to invest their means in such an enterprise if they could be assured that the business would be honestly and faithfully managed. if the affairs of the company were properly and judiciously managed, all expenses might be met and a liberal percentage paid to the stock-holders on their investments. one hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars invested in the vacant lands of any unoccupied district would form the nucleus for a populous and prosperous colony. but, i fear my article is growing too lengthy. i have offered these suggestions in the hope that some of our wealthy and true friends will act upon them. very respectfully and truly yours, s. h. smothers. "
1873,8,14,1873081401204,New National Era,VA,"education, industry and economy. ","to the editor of the new national era and citizen: these three enter largely into the operation of every man's life which ends in success. the deterioration of man's pristine excellence renders education necessary to lead out that which is good in him. in no pursuit in life is a man so secure from the shoals and quicksands, incidental to all pursuits, than he whose avocation is not only polished but balanced by education. [...] economy. - by economy we mean a judicious arrangement of human affairs, as opposed to proffigacy, which is human action in want on riot. if we would watch dame nature we would find ample lessons of economy. there is nothing lost ; but simply transmuted. and now i have briefly introduced these three subjects, i will endeavor to apply them. i ask the attention of the laboring colored man especially to acquire these three important things as the earnest means to elevation, and independence among his fellow men. in some cases men must begin with the last, economy, and proceed to education. such i deem the need of the adult. and how can this be done? i can conceive of no better plan than husbanding your earnings. take care of the penny and the pound will take care of itself. and when temptations be set your forward your money to one of the branches of the national fsb. in this city we are doing a great and manifold work. at the head of affairs we have an honest, upright and loving friend of our race, mr. alvord. next in order and most essential is our actuary, w. stickney, the friend of the young man. he is the right man, and in the right place, and not only is he efficient, but his manners are the strenght and life of the institution. nor are we, once oppressed, and denied of all advantages, doing otherwise than well. we are growing such as messrs. george johnson and w. t. tomkins, shining lights in our city, young men whose efficiency promise a great future. we have also our rising young lawyers in this institution, messrs. c. thomas and j. h. cook. this latter gentleman has done faithful service in howard university as chief clerk in the bureau of refugees, etc., etc., and is now one of the trustees. i mention these particulars to show our friends in the south that « we are about a great work », the purpose of which is elevation and progress. but i cannot fail to mention an invaluable agent in all the success which the bank has achieved, namely prof. w. j. wilson. this man gave birth to the great thought - a fsb - when others were slumbering, and knew not by what means the new freedman may become a man indeed, and we are surprised to find that after toil and efficiency mr. wilson is today but cashier of the fsb. if the bank is a success it is but the exponent of the success of the freedmen, and he should share largely in its fortunes. d. a. s.

it was suggested last night that perhaps the fsb of macon would be affected by the failure; but upon inquiry of one of its officers, we learn that the house did not owe it a dollar. it was also suggested that this failure and others which were sure to follow, would militate against southern finances. but this, too, is fallacious, for we have all our crop of cotton on hand, and england, not the united states, dictates the price. 
in the community at large there was no sympathy detected for cooke and his company. it was well known that during and since the war they were bitter enemies of the south. 
so far as macon banks are concerned, the balance with all northern banks, just now, are greatly against them, and they, therefore, cannot be hurt no matter to what extent cook's failure may go."

1873,9,24,1873092420201,New York Herald,NY,the savings banks,"a tour of the savings banks by a herald reporter
yesterday revealed the fact that, as stated
above, ""comparative"" quiet existed all over.
what reasoning by word of month failed to accomplish
was effected by printed placards, which instructed
callers that no deposits would be returned
short of receiving proper notice, thirty or sixty
days' ahead,
the seaman's saving institution,
on wall street, has had ho run. at the same time
the thirty days' clause has been taken advantage
of by the directors, who declare, however, that
they have over $1,000,000 surplus, and can withstand
any financial storm that may arise. considerable
deposits were made there yesterday.
the mutual benefit savings bank,
on printing house square, has had no run. the
sixty days' notice had been displayed there. up
to three o'clock only fifteen persons had filed notice
to withdraw their deposits.
emigrant industrial savings bank 
in chambers street, had a slight ran yesterday
morning. the directors ordered a notice posted
informing depositors that an amounts under $100
will be paid without notice being given, but all intended
withdrawal of amounts over that sum must
be noted thirty days in advance.
manhattan savings institution.
this establishment, situated at the corner of
broadway and bleecker street, requires no notice
for withdrawal of deposits. there was no perceptible
run on this bank yesterday. on the contrary,
a number of depositors who had drawn their
money on monday returned the same yesterday.
confidence seems to have been entirely restored
among the patrons of this bank.
bowery savings bank.
although this bank, in its report to the general
superintendent of banks, shows the largest suplus
 and soundest condition, it has, nevertheless
posted large placards inside and outside of the
building notilylng depositors that thirty days' notice
must be given before withdrawing any sums
of $100 and under, and sixty days for amounts
above that. no run there yesterday.
the north river savings bank,
corner of eighth avenue and thirty-fourth street,
has issued similar notices to those of the larger
institutions. at a meeting of the board of directors,
held yesterday, it was decided that, in view
of tne many poor people having deposits there,
sums of $10 and under be paid out on demand.
:arger amounts, however, require notice.
other banks.
the atlantic, broadway, claremont, dry dock,
clinton, east river, excelsior, merchants', clerks',

1873,9,25,1873092501203,New National Era,VA,to the depositors of the freedman's bank. your money perfectly safe.,"the « run » on this bank has ceased. those who deposited their money with the trustees of the fsb, on calling for it have received it. this fact shows that the money has been safely kept. although, under the rules of the company, sixty days' notice might have been demanded before closing out accounts, yet, in the fearful panic of the past few days, such notice was waived, and every depositor who presented himself at the counters of the washington branch was promplty paid. having shown its soundness and its willingness to pay even when the other savings banks in this city found it prudent to insist upon notice, it deserves renewed confidence. in this connection it is worth while to assure the people of the country that this bank has no connection with any of the failing banking houses, has no money invested in railroad stocks and wild-cat securities. under the charter of this bank it is allowed to invest only in united states bonds and real estate securities. it is only necessary to give little time to convert these securities into money, when every dollar deposited can be returned. the people of the country are assured that this is one of the safest banking institutions in the land. with branches in new york, philadelphia, baltimore, washington, and all the leading cities of the south, it transacts business without any close connection with other banking houses. for the convenience of its own depositors money is transferred from any one branch to another without risk or large expense. conducted by careful men, given to no adventures, influenced by considerations of perfect safety as a first necessity in a savings bank, we cannot commend this institution in too high terms. even the negro minstrels traversing the country share with us this feeling of perfect confidence in the fsbs, and bring rounds of applause in giving expression to that feeling in their poculiar, comic songs. the georgia minstrels, on visiting washington during the fearful panic of friday and saturday, the 19th and 20th instants, sang to the great delight of their audience. « de washington banks are quite gwine to bust: ole aunt jemima, &c., in the fsbs we puts our trusts, ole aunt jemima », &c. without any attempt to reflect upon other washington banks, in common with the sentiment of the ministrels, we put our trust in the fsb. to the depositors who withdrew their money from this bank during the panic, we say redeposit at once before you spend o lose your small earnings. pickpockets and thieves will have a fine feast unless you need our advice. we suggest also that our leading men, and especially the preachers in our churches, can do much to allay the excitement which naturally followed the moneyed panic of the past few days. the people who have not time to make themselves familiar with the internal condition of the bank, simply need to be assured by those who do understand, that all is well, and they will be satisfied. we do not say these things for the benefit of the managers of the bank, but rather for the good of the people. great injury results to hundreds of men and women who in time of frenzy rush to a bank and withdraw their funds when not needed. much money withdrawn during the late excitement will be wasted unless our leaders and influential men urge the people to redeposit. we have discharged our duty in this regard.

notwithstanding the heavy run we have been subjected to for the last few days. my opinion is that the run was caused by diver articles that appeared in the constitution, the heaviest run was made on yesterday, in consequence of a paragraph in the constitution, which was in substance-""that twenty-six of the saving banks established among the freedmen of the south, were in correspondence with jay cooke & co., at the close of last year."" this statement is false in toto. at that time there was not a single savings bank in the south in correspondence with jay cooke & co. no saving bank has bad anything to do with cooke & co. since then. the fsbs never deposited with jay cooke & co. they are all in correspondence and deposit with their ""northern bank"" in new york city. the american exchange national bank clears for us at the clearing house in new york. they have a capital of five million besides a large surplus. reporter-are you at all apprehensive of trouble from this run on the bank from depositors. mr. corey-we have stood the run for four days and are still unembarrassed; we are amply able to pay every depositor, but i tell you frankly if this run continues, we will take advantage of the thirty days rule. 

reporter-is this feeling of insecurity general or confined to certain classes of depositors. mr. corey-the bulk of our depositors are not at all uneasy: it is principally the more ignorant portion of them and those who have small accounts. our depositors are generally men who are easily frightened. they have received much bad advice from a certain portion of the citizens regarding their solvency; advising them to run to the bank and draw their money, if they did not want to lose it, while the better class of the white people have been remarkably kind to us; and we are under many obligations to many of them for indorsing and speaking kindly of us. we are especially grateful to the other banks for the many favors they have extended us. reporter-your bank is at least perfectly secure, is it not? are you not connected with the other saving banks in the south? mr. corey-all the fsbs in the united states are in reality one bank, with branches, and in my judgment is the strongest institution in the south, all investments being made in government bonds and real estate secured by mortgages."

1874,1,22,1874012213201,Port Royal Commercial,SC,affairs of the freedmen's savings bank,"there is a probability that an investigation into the affairs of the fsb will soon be moved in the house. the concern was chartered in 1865, and has a branch in nearly every town of importance in the south. the money collected at these branches is sent here for investment, and the amount thus gathered is estimated at from three to four million dollars. by the terms of the charter two-thirds of the receipts were directed to be put into united states bonds. in 1857 the law was amended so as to permit loaning on real estate secured by mortgage, the value of the real estate security to be worth twice the amount of the loan. the amendment, it is supposed, was in the interests of the district ring, then in its incipiency. under the law granting the charter, no reports were provided for, noa is there any satisfactory way of getting a clear showing of the condition of the institution, the law merely providing that congress should have the right to inspect, which has never yet been done. the officers of the bank have grown suddenly wealthy, it is said, and although there seems to be a fair field for inquiry. no like concern ecer yet has had so good an opportunity for defrauding and if it has neglected the chance, the development of the fact will be a refreshing relief to the monotonous thievery of the day.

1874,2,19,1874021901203,New National Era,VA,letter of john p. sampson on the freedman's banks in the south. ,"treasury department, third auditor's office, washington, jan. 22, 1874. i desire, sir, to say through your journal and every other accessible medium, of whatever political shade, interested in the material development of our section, that while i am in favor of the fsb as a savings institution, we can never expect to see our city become a money-circulating centre for the south, nor important as a wholesale, business and trading metropolis, so long as we are indifferent as to where the monies, the result of the thrift and energy of its tradesmen and manual laboring people, are sent and circulated. our money must be kept at home and put to work among the people of whom it is earned, unless there is no demand for its use, with as good percentage and security as it will get abroad. true political economy teaches that we are not only to be careful how we spend our money, but we are to spend it intelligently, with reference to the need of others as well as ourselves, knowing the exact channel through which it passes, even when hypothecated in any manner of trade above its face value in scrip or coin, in order that a pro rato benefit may accrue to the spender and the entire business community. the town is continually being drained of every dollar expended in meeting the ordinary expenses for comfort and labor, and this is the most active circulating capital in any city. the money earned and saved can find a healthy circulating level in business, or loans, negotiated easier, and with less expense to borrower and lender at home, where it is earned, and with more profit to the community and all parties concerned, than it can get abroad. the whole money-saving scheme instituted for the good of our people in the south, is conducted on a plan that stagnates the financial atmosphere of the money-spending, and manual laboring class. the passage of money from one hand to another, in small circle of business men, one or two hours sooner or later, and owned by each other for each other, but a few hours, makes or saves a man from becoming a bankrupt; and by a few hours' misconnection in money matters, may embarrass the entire business community. now, what i with to say is this: if a few hours stagnation in the active funds of a community, can thus embarrass the business of a town what must be the effect when it is gathered up by the smalls in a savings bank, and sent away to work in the interest of those in other communities, making business for hundreds of working men, and borrowed for this active service by men who can no better affort to borrow, and who can pay no more for its use than the capitalist of our own city. when a bank is established in our community, it is presumed that, like other banking houses belonging to the place, it is established for the benefit of the people residing there, by loaning and taking care of the funds in the interest of the depositors and the community. money can be borrowed by citizens, but the loan is negotiated at an enormous expense to both parties and it is not the policy of the washington bank to grand loans through the branch banks, while here your money is loaned every day, and with personal advantage if necessary to the officers negotiating the loan: but those who create the capital, where the banks are located, are not allowed to loan nor borrow through the branch officers. why not allow all the funds deposited at a certain point to remain there as a trading capital for the benefit of the branch, the depositors and the people? why seek a borrower abroad when we have them here with a [?] of freedom who know the people better? ask the main bank to allow us to keep our own money and empower the directors and our efficient cashier of the branch to negotiate loans with good collaterals. the washington bank has a lien on more property than any other banking house in washington, with great profit to itself and every business interest in the community. what good does investment do our people? any one can this see the damaging results of the system. if the charter will not allow any change, let the colored people of the south ask congress through their representative to so amend the charter as to give less advantage to one quarter and a more equal change among the depositors where the branch is located, and especially where the cashier is capable of negotiating a loan with good security. the managers tell our colored business men in the south desiring this accommodation through their own branch, such as they can, and do get of other banks in southern communities, that they « do not loan money, and that it would be very unsafe to accommodate the colored capitalist and business men south by investment with them, and yet colored men and more white men are accommodated here. they say money will go of itself where it is in best demand in its best interest. how can this money get a demand at home when it is legislated away by the washington bank in order to accommodate the bank and people of washington. this sort of argument has worn threadbare, and is only true when made in the interest of those who make it. the statement is a superstitious one, and if made against business white men in the south, it is an appeal to the political prejudices of the negro, against his best interest; if it is made against colored men in the south, who will compare with colored men elsewhere, it is a sad reflection, on their integrity, when compared with both white and colored who are accomodated in the washington bank. i say this in the best interest of « the southern branches, it cry », « mad dog » by saying a negro is opposed to the bank, would be to me the best evidence that i am correct.

1874,3,19,1874031901203,New National Era,VA,stockholders of the new national era and citizen.,"chas. n. thomas is a young lawyer on the quibble order, who pays more attention to his personal appearance than anything else ; he is well known by all who have had the fortune (?) of doing business with him. he was so eager to get something for nothing, that he disposed of his four shares of stock in the new national era and citizen company, valued at $50 each, for $15, inside of three days after the formation of the company, to a friend of his, and boasted about his sharpness in so doing; after which he used his legal ability (?) to break up the company which he had helped to originate. the above shows what this honorable (?) gentleman's ideas were about the company from the start. john h. cook is another young lawyer, more fortunate, however, than thomas, as far as means are concerned, having passed all through the freedman's bureau, and has come out qualified to fill george stickney's place as actuary of the fsb, which he is so cunningly working to secure. cook is a stockholder in the new national era and citizen company ; he has worked faithfully to either rule the company or destroy it. in this he has been as successful as he was while trustee of the county schools of washington, d. c. he was authorized to select a site for the erection of a new school-house in the district by the board of trustees of county schools, and to do so at the lowest rates possible. d. m. kelsey, of the treasury department, happened to own a couple of lots near howard university for which he asked cook a certain sum of money. cook, seeing a chance to make a little money, sends one charles n. thomas, a young lawyer, ever ready for a job, to offer kelsey one hundred dollars less in cash than asked. kelsey accepted. cook brought into the board a report stating that the lots could not be purchased for less than kelsey's first demand. the board accepted, and cook and thomas divide $100 between them. this being thomas' first job since being admitted to the bar, he boasted of it everywhere he happened to find willing listeners of his success. o. s. b. wall, then a candidate for delegate from the second district, heard of this little job of cook's, who was opposing him, and declared his intention of exposing him. cook, hearing of this, hastened to thomas and gave back the $50 retained as his share, though the board and tax-payers lost just the same. captain wall, however, never forgave cook, and had him removed from the board as one unfit for that responsible position. richard t"" greener owns four shares of stock in the new national era and citizen company, upon which he has paid $50 in cash and given his notes for the balance, which is $175. although the author of « young men to the front », and desirous of the success of the cause which he holds so dear, he refuses to pay his notes, and ran out of town to prevent a suit for the same. greener is, no doubt, a very shrewd man ; he offered to take up his notes with unpaid stock, and boasted that he was going to break the only organ of his race in the district, because the officers of the company refused to accede to his proposition, and he couldn't run the paper in his individual interest, which was the real cause of his withdrawal from the editorial staff. thomas s"" boston, of the fsb of washington, d. c., is another stockholder in the new national era and citizen company, who subscribed for four shares of stock, paid $25 cash, and gave notes for three, six, and twelve months, for $175 ; he, also, refuses to pay, on any ground that charles n. thomas chooses to manufacture for him. we think him anything else than a fit person to be in the fsb, for, when a man gives his note in good faith, and acknowledges the same to be his before a justice of the peace, and still refuses to pay without any good legal reason, he should vacate his position for some one else who will set a better example. george d. johnson, book-keeper in the fsb, also holding stock in the new national era and citizen company, has refused to pay his note, simply because cook and others have refused to pay. george has been somewhat successful in business for the past two years, and is about to enter into the real estate business with john h. cook and james t. wormley, jr. george will come out « a sadder and a wiser man ». wm. e. augusta, another employe of the fsb and stockholder in the new national era and citizen company, refuses to pay his notes. augusta simply took stock because he saw the rest of the honorable (?) parties of the bank flourishing their trumpets high with promises, which they never intended to fulfill ; nevertheless, he says it was taken and his notes given in good faith ; still the cause is so dear for which he took stock, he must follow suit and refuse to pay. john h. butler, formerly of baltimore, likewise an employe of the bank, and stockholder in the new national era and citizen company, prefers to not pay his notes, and, greener like, runs away pending a suit for the same. the above-named parties are backed by the officers of the fsb against the douglass brothers, and the new national era the only organ of their race at the capital. this bank was a greeley concern during the presidential campaign, and it has never gotten over the reference to the same in the new national era. that there is a deep-laid plan to break up the douglass brothers in their publishing a journal here in washington in the interest of their race, there is scarcely room for a doubt. how well these malicious parties will succeed remains to be seen. we understand the object of the secret meetings which have been held for the past six months, and in future, intend to handle these parties without gloves. observer.

the deference in the herald of tuesday to the present condition of the fsb was not only just, but considerate and generous, and displays your well known love of fair play. while that reference told the simple truth about the bank, there was nothing in it to produce distrust and to start a run upon its deposits. of course no banking institution in the land can well afford to invite runs upon its deposits, and it is not to excite such runs without good and almost irresistible necessity. within the last eighteen months, the freedman’s bank, by reason of suspicions set afloat through the press and otherwise has suffered three heavy runs upon its deposits. the one of these which occurred during half a million dollars to carry the bank safely through it, and the fact that it was able to survive a shock which brought other long standing and long trusted institutions to the ground, may just now be stated without boasting in its favor.
the fsb as its name imports, was especially established to encourage and assist the freedmen to save and increase their hard earned money and thus to help them in the race to knowledge and higher civilization. this institution has been in existence less than ten years and during that time it has held and handled with profit to its depositors, not less than $25,000,000. the bank now comes before the public, after the severest valuation of its property rating article at their lowest cash value,
in these, dull times, with its liabilities $217,000 in excess of its assets. every business man will see at once that with assets amounting as they do to more than $3,000,000, if only tolerably well managed and let well alone, a few months only would be required to enable it to overcome this small excess of liabilities and pay all its depository a small amount of interest.
my connection with the freedman’s bank as its president it of very recent date. i accepted the
position with the honest purpose to forward as well as i might the beneficent objects had in view by its founder to watch and guard the hard earnings of my people, and to see that those earnings shall be kept to their profit if possible, but kept safely at any rate.
in regard to the condition of the branches, i sent last night through the associated press all over the southern states a quieting telegram assuring our depositors that, in the opinion of the officers of the bank, if the depositors will exercise only a reasonable degree of patience, we shall be able to pay dollar for dollar; and this is my opinion now.
respectfully, yours, frederick douglass. washington, april 29, 1874:

time, but also because of the great power for good there is in the bank itself. elsewhere we touch upon
the matter of savings as a means of advancement in life, and our purpose is here briefly, to call attention
to this bank and its condition and prospects.
created by the government at the close of the war, the fsb came at once to the help of the poor and oppressed colored people, offering the best of all relief—the means or self-help. a savings bank of the best and simplest kind, it sprang fully armed like minerva from the head of jove to the relief and protection of the helpless and ignorant. it has done its work nobly. treated with laughter and scorn—its officers insulted, its patrons despised, it wont quietly and steadily on in its work. the poor came to it and were shown the road to wealth. the helpless came and were taught the secret of power. the despised came and were given the road to respectability. the road was, careful saving; the secret was, spend less than you earn; the pass word was, owe, no man anything and call no man master.
animated by such motives, the despised colored man soon found his work, organized through the bank, gave power and power gave respect. the bank took its place among the foremost banks of the world. millions poured into its vaults millions were paid back to buy the homesteads and cottages that to-day dot the sunny south from virginia to texas, home humble may be, but homes never theless, dear to their owners, and the sure foundation of still greater prosperity. all these years every dollar of surplus earnings went to the depositors as interest. more than a million of dollars have been poured into the lap of the south during these years as interest paid the depositor in the bank, adding not only so vast a sum 'o the wealth of the south but furnishing also the most powerful of all reasons, the love of gain, for breaking up that curse of the country, the spirit of hoarding. money was no longer buried like the talent of the unfaithful servant in scripture; but was brought out and put to work for the sake of the interest. no longer a miser's treasure it became capital, and this capital the fsb created. yet more, it wrought upon men who had never saved, and made prudent hard working, saving men. such a bank must have enemies. every man who hates liberty hates the bank—for the depositors with his bank account is a free man. every man who hates equality before the law hates the bank—for it treats all men a like. every man who hates the government hates the bank—for the government created and fosters it. and so the bank has many enemies. and so it has happened that as it has grown in power its enemies have increased their efforts to destroy it. they have not succeeded in destroying it but they have done it much harm, and will not cease trying until it is made evident that they cannot succeed.
and now the bank, under a new and stronger charter, will begin a new life. in the face of hard times, at the end of a great panic that has left the working people poor, after standing four runs caused by its
enemies alone, the bank begins a new work and calls upon the people to sustain it. and the way to sustain it is to use it, put your money in it, keep it there until you have need to use it. permit no runs, as
these destroy the use of your money and harm only yourselves, in short, stand by the bank as you would by your best friend, and you will find it to be your best friend and the greatest power for good the colored people of the country have had, or ever will have.
